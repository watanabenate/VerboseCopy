Buddypal Playpen has something for everyone: comedic improv, ASMR, educational value, Q/A, tutorials on how to cook the best of momma's favorite cupcakes, and so much more! Best of all, it's made by BUDDYPAL BRIGADE! Everyone loves Buddypal Brigade! Just give it a listen, and you'll find yourself astrol planing into a universe we've created just for you. Conveniently, you might also find a sandwich in the astrol fridge with your name on it. Don't eat it, that's Zach's. He always forgets about the leftovers and leaves them for other people. Don't worry, Justin can get you something to eat. How about a metaphorical dad talk sandwich covered in--you're vegan? We don't serve vegan food in the astrol plane! What were you thinking coming out here to the Buddypal Brigade astrol plane? Free food? We aren't the church over here man! Get back in your body and find yourself some dang food!

This hits hard for Carlos, especially, who proclaims yet another American pop icon as his personal Jesus Christ. Megan dissects the true puzzle pieces behind a fighter pilot's cockpit, the derailment of women's rights for our generation, and gets picked on a little less for her supporting arguments. Ryan remains in true form, picking on Megan for basically...all the things, identifies Carlos's ass as \"nice,\" and all the meanwhile, earns yet another nickname proclaiming his role in Suburbia. In spite of Megan's attempt to set a podcast \"agenda,\" classic Real Suburbia derailments ensue and a dumpster fire of personal stories, emotions, opinions, and epiphanies erupt in this latest episode. Keep it real, Real Suburbia Nation; because if you aren't making it happen, you've only got the three of us to rely on. Welcome to the Thunderdome! We hope you've got your helmet!!",

In this episode, Carlos and Megan discuss their favorite songs from their high school years (1990-1994). Carlos promises to never get singing lessons as he has the \"voice of an angle\".  If you can get through the potential ear bleeding, please enjoy this trip down memory lane! Megan's mom innocently sings 2 Live Crew, Carlos goes punk, don't go chasing rabbit holes, Bobby Brown gets booed, a Wilson Phillips/Boyz II Men duet is pitched, and so much more. Somehow Megan does not mention Fred Savage and, of course, there are dramatic Nextdoor readings. ",

It all started while the two of them binge watched Disney +'s Encore, where people go back to high school as adults to relive and perform in their high school musical. They start off by warming up to a song that was popular during that time and it gave Megan and Carlos the idea to go back and come up with a few songs that stick out from their middle school years  (1985-1989). They cover Madonna, SWV, Bon Jovi, INXS, Paul Young, Billy Ocean, U2, and more! Unfortunately, they do attempt to sing, so you have been warned. Come along for a trip down their Gen X memory lane--they promise not to release any couple's duet albums if you listen to this episode.",

I want to fly a duck someday, I mean, it's always something I've wanted to do, there's a whole deal there, I mean, flying a tiny one, no... You've got to get a giant freaking duck and ride that thing to heaven. I just realized, I think I'm slowly losing my British accent in my writing. It's becoming more American. I can't tell if that's a good thing, but I've been able to try Taco Bell, and if that means anything, this continent is so much better than that one (except for your tea, it's shit). Also, a good scone is 10 times better than one of your American donuts. Still, I love Krispy Kreme. I think I flew an orange in my dreams yesterday. That's probably where the whole thing came from. Oooo, gotta tell you, I've been writing a Dream Journal since last year, and I think I might publish it sometime in 2021 (or maybe later).\n\"That Pointless Podcast\" is produced by Jinxed Sink Media Productions Company.

A few of them might be a tad stale, but that's probably because they were hot glued to my monitor. It might seem bonkers, but I like food, so sometimes I get snacky, and I end up needing a snack fast, donut holes glued to my monitor seems like a fun way to do it, so it's just there and no one can complain about it. It does smell kinda bad sometimes, but you get used to it. Plus, I clean this room up daily, I'm just a naturally messy person. Okay, I think I might need to use the restroom now, probably the ICEE from our home theatre (AKA snow cone from ice we put in the blender that we ate while staring at a laptop and sitting on a torn up couch)!
