This week, I am joined by an actor and very dear friend of mine, Jack Sunderland.I have known Jack for over a decade, and together we have gone through college, drama school and had the pleasure of breaking in to the industry as professional actors. In this episode we chat about the films that inspire us as actors, but also as film fans. We discuss some of the newest releases to streaming, such as Together, starring James MCcavoy & Sharon Horgan, as well as Time, starring Sean Bean- both currently available on BBC iPlayer. I had a real blast chatting to Jack, he has a lot of great film knowledge and insight, so hopefully you will be able to take a lot from it! Due to sudden unforeseen circumstances (me being pinged by the NHS App), I had to self-isolate for 6 days, and therefore we couldn't record the episode in person, we had to conduct the interview through ZOOM; Jack's audio is a little echoey in moments, but hopefully you will adjust to it fairly quickly and enjoy the discussions!

                                "description": "Hello! Welcome to another episode and thank you for coming back! This episode is the first BONUS episode and the first of the mid-week, \"Creative Spotlight\" series I am running alongside the main guest episodes. I am shining a creative spotlight on the truly amazing, multi-talented, and recently Oscar-winning writer, Emerald Fennell! Fennell wrote and directed the incredibly poignant and entertaining Promising Young Woman, which earned her the Oscar for Best Screenplay, as well as nominations for Best Director, Best Picture, and Best Actress in a Leading Role (Carrie Mulligan). Fennell is also a very talented actress and recently appeared as Camilla Parker- Bowles in the Netflix crown jewel, The Crown. She was also a regular on Call The Midwife and appeared in the Channel 4 sitcom Chickens. Her other credits include The Danish Girl, Anna Karenina, Vita & Virginia & Albert Nobbs. It's fair to say that Fennell has really come into her own as a writer, working as a co-writer on the hit BBC show Killing Eve and it has now been revealed that she is writing the screenplay for the upcoming DCEU Film Katanna. She has also written the book for Andrew Lloyd Webber's recent musical adaptation of Cinderella. In this episode, I chat about what makes her work on Promising Young Woman so effective and the choices she made as both a writer and director of the film. I discuss her work on The Crown and why she is currently such an important figure in the film industry.
