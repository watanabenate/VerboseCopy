Sarah and her children Kaleb, Kylie, Johnathon, Destiny, Brandon, and Alanna were mercilessly killed by their own family member- Sarah's father, Don Spirit in September of 2014. We try our best to break down the murders, the motives, and the tragic stories that led up to their final moments. Mental illness, substance abuse, and trauma are all things we try not to talk about; but, these are the exact things we should be talking about.

To maintain their traditions, many communities have established yeshivas, which are schools that emphasize the principles of Orthodox Judaism. It is on the morning of Sabbath, Saturday November 1st 1986, that 15 year old Chaim Wiess was bludgeoned to death in his dormitory at a Yeshiva in Long Beach, New York. There were no signs of a struggle, no witnesses, no murder weapon. This case remains unsolved, but, Chaim Weiss will be remembered today. And hopefully, his case will be solved. This is the murder of Chaim Weiss.\nJoin us on Instagram and Facebook @crimecafepod\nBuy merch here: https://bit.ly/2TPcVL7\nEmail: crimecafepod@yahoo.com\nSources:\n\n https://bit.ly/3oSS9az\n https://bit.ly/3iOhS03\n bit.ly/3am1tvg\n https://nyti.ms/2Yz26PW\n https://bit.ly/3mK56kx\n\n\n--- \n\nThis episode is sponsored by \n· Anchor: The easiest way to make a podcast.  https://anchor.fm/app\n",
