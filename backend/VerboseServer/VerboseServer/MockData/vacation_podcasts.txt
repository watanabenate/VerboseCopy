TIPS FOR TAKING FAMILY PHOTOS  Say NO to Auto is a book written to help people understand the basics of shooting in manual settings. Sometimes the lenses that come with your kit are not the best. Have a good lens is important for taking great pictures. The best camera positions for family photo would be eye level or birds eye view. If you are in the sun make sure that your camera is in the sun as well, that is the best way to avoid having your background being blown out. Change it up. It's always great to have a variety of poses, not just everyone standing and smiling Incorporating your kid's ideas is a great break up in your photos. It will also help with getting the family to participate. Getting your photos up on the wall or in an album is a great reminder of your fun times.  FAVORITE TRAVEL GEAR ‘Tieks’ flats are very colorful and slightly more on the dressy side but the are comfortable enough for walking all day on your vacations.

This week, we turned to the expert, Amy Whitley from Pit Stops for Kids, to get her best tips for when, where and how to camp with kids -- including suggestions on the best camping gear.

A lifelong lover of the outdoors, Amy helps families get outside with their kids in all seasons. You can follow Amy on Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest and Twitter. FAMILY CAMPING TIPS   Start with car camping where you can drive to your campsite Look at your state park website for the First Time Campers program Use GetOutfitted.com to rent gear for the first time to try gear out Join a backpacking group or guided hike through a gear store to get started Take kids when they are young so they are used to being outdoors and not intimidated, but if they are babies it is more work than reward Families with toddlers and preschoolers might want to use a portable crib to have a clean place for kids to hang out Start with a two-night trip, possibly close enough to home so you can abort early if needed, but setting up and breaking down is time consuming so you want to have a full day to enjoy yourselves When camping in an RV, you can be closer together because you have more insulation from sound and privacy For car camping, look for walk-in sites where you have a parking spot but you walk a bit in to the campsite so you feel a little more isolated Look for where the showers, sinks and dumpsters are so you can choose your spot wisely Private campgrounds are more resort-like with pools, playgrounds, etc State parks and national park campgrounds might feel more \"outdoorsy\" What to bring: tent, sleeping bag, pad/cot, shoe organizer to hang with kitchen gears or a camp kitchen, rope to hang up towels/clothes, welcome mat to wipe off shoes before going into the tent, lots of garbage bags, plastic tote boxes to bring gear when car camping, frozen water bottles, and headlamps Favorite camping meals: fajitas, soup, chilis, hamburgers, steaks, breakfast burritos and other grill items Prep your food in advance and bring them in ziplock bags Set up a trail mix bar so everyone can design their own trail mix Favorite activities: scavenger hunts, campground bingo, ranger-led activities, geocaching, bikes/scooters   FAVORITE TRAVEL GEAR Amy's favorite shoes for camping are Keen closed-toe sandals or Crocs for around camp. For hiking shoes, kids can generally use sneakers or trail running shoes. She is also a big believer in Columbia long-sleeve hiking shirts and convertible, zip-off pants. She also likes to bring bandanas or buffs for multi-purpose use. TIP OF THE WEEK  Plan your camp menu in advance so you can buy and prep everything you need in advance and not forget some important items like condiments!

Joining the team in 2010, Brittany has had the opportunity to launch annual events, new attractions and The Wizarding World of Harry Potter. Brittany is currently leading efforts to open the newly-enhanced The Incredible Hulk Coaster, opening in late summer, and Universal's first water theme park, Volcano Bay, opening in 2017. You can follow Universal Orlando on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.     TIPS FOR VISITING UNIVERSAL ORLANDO  Stay on property to get into the parks and hour earlier than general admission (especially if you are a Harry Potter fan) Get to the gate early as they often open the turnstiles before it would open because the opening time is usually the time they start the rides. This gives you time to get back to your favorite rides Go to Ollivander's wand shop early to not have a line and have a better chance of being selected to participate The Express Pass is a must-do for thrill-seekers, especially if you can get the unlimited Express Pass so you can ride attractions multiple times Child swap is available for parents of small children Bring a small day bag (not a large backpack) that will fit into the ride lockers The Harry Potter rides have a lot of storytelling that happens just in line so if you have a pocket that buttons, you may want to bring a phone or small camera to capture those moments, but even if you don't, just take your time to enjoy those aspects of the ride The Minions ride is very popular so even the Express Pass lane is very long but if you want, you can go in the \"no motion\" line and that is generally very short. It is the same ride experience except the ride vehicle doesn't move. Best times to visit:  Universal Orlando's Mardi Gras (January-February) with parades and great performances Halloween Horror Nights -- for those 13+ there are scare zones, haunted houses and special after dark events It is busiest when kids are out of school but it can get busy during special events also   You can purchase Express Passes in advance or on-site (but the price will go up based on availability)  WHAT'S NEW AT UNIVERSAL ORLANDO New details have been released about changes to The Hulk this summer:  King Kong also opens this year, see more details here.   Volcano Bay opens in 2017 and will be Universal's first waterpark, located near the Cabana Bay Resort, which they promise will \"completely redefine the waterpark experience.\" HOTELS AT UNIVERSAL ORLANDO  Loews Portofino Bay Hotel -- modeled after an Italian village Loews Royal Pacific Resort -- themed after the South Pacific Hard Rock Hotel -- looks like Hotel California from the Eagles album cover Cabana Bay Beach Resort -- beach retro hotel You get unlimited Express Pass access when you stay at Loews Portofino Bay, Loews and the Hard Rock Cafe All hotels have early access to the theme parks, dining on property and free transportation to the parks In 2016, they are opening the Loews Sapphire Falls Resort will be themed after the Caribbean with waterfalls and the largest pool on-site.  FAVORITE RESTAURANTS IN UNIVERSAL ORLANDO  Leaky Cauldron and Three Broomsticks (in Diagon Alley and Hogsmeade) -- Brittany likes the Great Feast at the Three Broomsticks Vivo Italian Kitchen -- fresh made pasta daily and homemade mozzarella Cowfish -- burgers and sushi NBS Sports Brew & Grill Hot dog Hall of Fame -- hot dogs from ballparks across the country Toothsome Chocolate Emporium & Savory Feast Kitchen opening in 2016  FAVORITE PARK GEAR Brittany always dresses comfortably with good walking shoes and clothes that are quick drying for the water rides. Kim likes using a sling bag when visiting amusement parks, like this one from Kavu. APP OF THE WEEK The Official Universal Orlando Resort app provides wait times, ride descriptions, maps, and dining information. You can also set alerts for rides to get a notification when the wait time goes below a certain time period.

She is a mom of three (15, 13, and 6) who loves to\ncreate exceptional memories with her family. Whether that be on the\nother side of the world or right down the street, her goal is to\nhelp families create exceptional memories too. You can find her\nwriting at R We There Yet\nMom?, or follow her on Facebook, Twitter,\nor Instagram.\n \n\nVISITING AUSTIN WITH KIDS\nAustin is known for South by Southwest Interactive in the\nSpring and Austin City Limits in the fall, but there is so much to\noffer families from a vibrant Hill Country with hiking and\nwaterskiing, to a ton of history and family attractions. A long\nweekend is sufficient for exploring the city but ideally families\nshould plan on four to five days. Sometimes families may combine a\ntrip to Austin with a visit to San Antonio.\n \nTexas State Capitol is 131 years old and made of pink granite\nto create a beautiful building with a whispering gallery, a Texas\nhistory museum for kids and memorials. Across the street you will\nfind Bullock Texas State History Museum.\n \nAnother must do is to to experience the outdoors\nat Zilker Park in downtown Austin where you can\nfly kites and swim in the Barton Springs Pool. Barton Springs Pool\nis manmade but fed by a natural spring so it is 68 degrees\nyear-round. The springs feed into Town Lake and you can rent\nkayaks, paddle boards and water bikes. After your water activities,\nyou can ride the Zilker Zephyr, a miniature train with excellent\nviews.\n \nAt night, you must see the Congress Avenue bats, which live\nunder the Congress Avenue Bridge from March through October. Every\nevening at dusk, the bats fly out from under the bridge en\nmasse.\n \nHowever, don't go to the legendary Sixth Street -- it is for\ncollege kids and above. But there are plenty of fun and eclectic\nshops on South Congress.\n \nSome off-the-beaten path places to visit in Austin:\n\nTom's Coffee Shop with a set up a Tom's shoes and a back yard\ngarden\nAustin Murals\nCathedral of Junk\n\nWHERE TO STAY IN AUSTIN\nRebecca recommends staying in downtown Austin at\nthe Driskill Hotel on the edge\nof Fifth and Sixth Street with unique, beautiful rooms. She also\nlikes the Four Seasons by Town Lake\nand the J.W. Marriott, which are both in\ngreat locations to walk to the main sites.\nWHERE TO EAT IN AUSTIN\nRebecca recommends:\n\nFranklin BBQ -- great BBQ but really long waits and there are\nmany other options\nSalt Lick BBQ in Dripping Springs\nMatt's El Rancho -- Tex-Mex that really caters to the kids with\nface painting, balloon animals...\nHome Slice Pizza on South Congress -- NY-style pizza with dough\nballs for the kids\nHopdoddy -- unique burgers\n\nBEST PLACE TO TAKE FAMILY PHOTO\n\nGreetings from Austin Mural -- on South First and Annie\nI Love You So Much Mural -- on South Congress on the side of\nJoe's Coffee house\nZilker Park field with downtown Austin and the Congress Avenue\nbridge in the background\nHike up Mount Bonnell and on the northwest side you overlook\nLake Austin and the downtown is behind you\n\nFAVORITE TRAVEL GEAR\nRebecca loves LuLaRoe leggings (just like Kim!) and Tom's\nshoes because they are comfortable and easy to slip on and\noff.\nTIP/APP OF THE WEEK\nGoogle Maps is a great app to use when walking around the city\nto find a walking path to your destination and get voice-guided,\nturn-by-turn directions. Plus, if you turn it on while you are in\nWiFi it even works when you have data turned off or if you are out\nof cell coverage.\nMENTIONED ON THE PODCAST\n\nPlanning a girlfriend getaway to Gulf Shores,\nAlabama \nThe Beach\nClub, Gulf Shores Alabama\nWhere to\neat in Gulf Shores, Orange Beach, Alabama\nThings to do in Austin, Texas\nlTip 5 Tips to See the Austin Bats\nAustin Water Bikes\n10 Tips for Families Visiting Krause\nSprings\nCathedral of Junk\n \n\n\nFOLLOW US AND SPREAD THE WORD!\n\nIf you liked this show, please be sure to subscribe\non iTunes, Stitcher, or Google\nPlay and leave us a review!\nHave a question or comment?

                                "description": "\n\nHilton Head, South Carolina offers wide beaches, sand dunes, golf resorts and family-friendly resorts and vacation rentals, making it a perfect vacation destination. Today we learn about family travel to Hilton Head, South Carolina from Karen Dawkins from Family Travels on a Budget.\nON THE PODCAST\n :43 Tamara is heading back to Gulf Shores, Alabama for a girlfriend getaway\n2:33 Kim's favorite beaches -- San Diego or Maui\n3:09 Tamara's favorite beaches -- Gulf Coast, FL; Outer Banks, NC\n5:00 Welcome Karen Dawkins from Family Travels on a Budget\n7:00 Family Travels on a Budget -- Paris for $7000?\n8:27 Hilton Head at Christmas (15th trip!!)\n9:35 Where is Hilton Head and how to get there\n10:15 How long to stay in Hilton Head\n11:07 What to do in Hilton Head\n12:23 Getting around Hilton Head\n13:07 Where to stay in Hilton Head\n14:10 Disney's Hilton Head  Resort\n14:51 The beach at Hilton Head\n17:16 When to book\n18:40 Where to eat in Hilton Head\n19:55 Where to take a family photo\n21:26 Karen's favorite travel gear\n23:17 Tip of the week\nAbout Karen Dawkins from Family Travels on a Budget\nKaren is the creator of Family Travels on a Budget, a website dedicated to helping families travel better for less. As she says, “Budget doesn’t mean cheap. It’s smart!” She has also been featured in print and online markets, and on podcast. You can follow her adventures on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and Pinterest.\n \nKaren is originally from Ohio but now lives in North Carolina and has been visited Hilton Head fifteen times. She travels with her husband, two sons and one daughter. We talk about why Hilton Head is great for families, what it is like to visit, what the beaches are like, what there is to do and Karen's favorite places to stay and eat.\n\nWhat to Do\nIf families want some time off the beach, there is plenty to do include paddle boarding, kayaking, and biking. Karen especially enjoys going to Pickney Island Nature Preserve with its wildlife, sea creatures and walking trails. Families on a budget can take advantage of the many city parks that are free and offer great family entertainment. Hilton Head is laid back and low key -- no neon or typical beach scene.\n\nWhere to Stay\nFamilies visiting Hilton Head would fly into Savannah, Georgia, just 45 minutes away. It is also not far off of Interstate 95. Families should plan on spending at least four days, but a week is ideal. There are three main areas to stay in Hilton Head: the Sea Pines Resort, where the big golf course is; Palmetto Dunes, which is the ocean front area that is great for beach lovers; and Disney's Hilton Head Resort that is Shelter Cove. Since it is more protected there, you will find stand up paddle boarding and other activities in this area. Karen recommends the Disney Hilton Head Resort for families. There are also many vacation condominiums available for rent that are perfect for families that want the space and comforts of home. \nWhere to Eat\nOne Hot Mama's features BBQ and low country food from the Next Food Network Star. Karen also loves the pizza at Mangiamo because she is a big Ohio sports fan and has found that all the Buckeye fans seem to congregate there.\nBest Place to Take a Family Photo in Hilton Head\nKaren suggests posing on a live oak tree branch at Coligny Beach for an ideal family photo. Perfect for holiday cards!\n\n \nYou can learn more about Karen's recommendations for Hilton Head over on Family Travels on a Budget including:\n\n\nHilton Head by the numbers -- What it costs off season \nWhy Hilton Head is great for families -- and a map of the island\nFive reasons to vacation at Hilton Head\n\nFavorite Travel Gear\nKaren loves her little black dress from J. Jill for its comfort and style.\n\n\nTip of the Week\nKim recommends bringing a small bottle of baby powder for your next trip to the beach, as it is perfect for getting sticky sand off your body. She also found a fun product at Beaches called the Powder Pouch, which works the same way.\n\nMentioned on the Podcast\n\nAlabama Beaches are Calling!\nMust Try Foods on the Alabama Gulf Coast\n \nRestaurants\nOne Hot Mamas \nMangiamo! -- best pizza on the island\n \n \nLodging\nDisney's Hilton Head Island Resort\nSea Pines Resort (golf and tennis)\nPalmetto Dunes (golf and beach)\n \nActivities\nMany resorts offer onsite bike, kayak and standup paddle board rentals\nBiking and kayaking through Hilton Head Outfitters\nPinckney Island Nature Preserve\nGolfing Hilton Head\nBristol Skate Park\n\n\n \nSorry for a bit of technical static on this one as we didn't have the best Skype connection for part of the interview! We would love to hear what you think and if you like what you hear, please tell a friend about Vacation Mavens!!",

We are chatting with Mary Solio from The World is a Book, who lives in Southern California, about LegoLand, the San Diego Zoo, Balboa Park, and Coronado Bay. Best of all, she shares tips on finding the best tacos and how to get your kids in free to popular attractions.\nON THE PODCAST\n:45 Welcome and weekly catch up\n3:23 Kim and Tamara talk about past trips to San Diego\n5:30 Welcome Mary Solio from The World is a Book\n9:00 Ideal itinerary for visiting San Diego\n9:55 Balboa Park\n10:25 Sea World, San Diego Zoo or the Safari Park\n11:00 Day 2: Beach hopping\n13:02 LegoLand\n15:32 Cabrillo National Monument\n16:26 Where to Stay\n18:20 Tips for visiting the Zoo\n19:20 Kids Free Month\n21:08 Disneyland\n22:25 Must try foods\n24:18 Where to take a family photo\n25:00 Favorite travel gear\n26:55 Tip of the week -- finding good deals\nAbout Mary Solio from The World is a Book\nMary lives in San Diego, California with her husband and two kids, who are 13 and 10. She was born in the Philippines, grew up in the U.S. territory of Guam, and believes all those years of island fever ignited her serious case of wanderlust. She currently works full time as a database developer and computer programmer. She writes about the familys travels along with tips and guides on her blog, The World Is a Book. She is also a family travel writer for Hilton Hotels and Resorts' Hilton Mom Voyage site. The family loves cruises, castles, National Parks, and museums, from art to quirky. You can follow her family's travels on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Pinterest.\nFive Days in San Diego\nIf you are in Southern California, it is easy to visit San Diego for a weekend or a day trip. But if you are coming from further away, Mary recommends at least a five to seven day stay.\nStart with a two-hour bay cruise to see seals and the city skyline and then vary your itinerary between theme parks and other attractions. After the bay cruise, head over to Balboa Park to visit some of their 15 museums, gardens and Spanish architecture.\nOn the second day, pick either Sea World, the San Diego Zoo or the Safari Park. The Safari Park has a lot of open area and is different than a typical zoo.\nFor day three, go beach hopping or kayaking. One of Mary's favorite beaches is the Coronado Beach near the hotel. She also likes LaJolla Shores to see the sea lions and to kayak near LaJolla Cove.\nThe next day, visit Legoland. If you are there from March through May there is a flower field on the hillside that is beautiful. If your family really loves Legos, a stay at Legoland Hotel seems like a special treat. They have four different types of theme rooms, including a new Lego Friends room.\nFor the last day, visit the tide pools at Cabrillo National Monument. Just check online first to find out when the tide is low. There are also other historical attractions at the Cabrillo National Monument.\nTips for Visiting San Diego\n\nFamily friendly hotels are in the Mission Valley area.\nThe Manchester Grand Hyatt near Seaport Village downtown is also a good pick for families.\nThere are other new hotels opening in Liberty Station and a new public market is coming to that area also.\nWhen visiting the zoo, start with a half-hour guided bus tour and then take the tram all the way to the back and work your way to the front.\nVisit during October when kids get into many attractions for free.\n\nMust Try Foods\nYou simply must have authentic Mexican food, especially carne asada and fish tacos, or the carne asada burrito with carne asada, cheese and fries rolled into a burrito. There are many taco stands throughout San Diego but Mary recommends anywhere with a \"bertos\" in it -- like Umbertos -- or Tacos al Gordo with a spiced pork taco.\nShe also loves the desserts at Extraordinary Desserts downtown.\nBest Place to Take a Family Photo\nThere are many scenic spots in San Diego but Mary's recommendation for a family photo is on the beach at Coronado Bay, with the iconic hotel behind you.\nFavorite Travel Gear\nMary loves traveling in convertible pants from Columbia and Converse without laces to get through security quickly.\nTip of the Week\nCityPass and GoCard are both available for San Diego, providing substantial discounts if you want to visit many attractions. Another tip when visiting a different city is to check their local Groupon and Living Social listings for deals on restaurants and attractions.\nMentioned in the Podcast\n50 Things to do in San Diego\nBalboa Park\nLegoland\nCabrillo National Monument\nSan Diego Bay Cruise\nIs CityPass or GoCard San Francisco Worth It?",

In the summertime you can also go horseback riding in this park! If you are a foodie, looking on Instagram hashtags is a great way to find places. #edibleDC The Kennedy Center has free nightly performances everyday of the year that start at 6pm. Instagram hashtag #igDC or #myDCcool is what people that live there use, and is a great way to find interesting things to do!

BEST PLACE TO TAKE FAMILY PHOTO Union Market has a heart mural that is great for a family photo other than in front of the White House.

Follow Shannon on Facebook, Pinterest, Twitter, Instagram and LinkedIn. CAMPERVAN FAMILY VACATION TIPS  The Jucy Camper Vans (or mini RVs) are set up mostly like a regular van. They have extra cushions for transform the inside into a bed that can sleep two. There is also an added pop up tent on top that can also sleep two. You will also find a kitchen set up in the trunk area of the van. Finding room for the luggage is a little tricky. Packing in duffle bags is the best tip for fitting your luggage better, because you can squish your bags into smaller areas. The van is 17ft long, so some campgrounds will be fine for you have a regular camp site while others you may need to rent a RV camp spot. You need to call ahead to find out how large the standard camping space is. The van is a lot like camping but you will still have to bring other camping essentials like flash lights or a head lamps. You may also want to bring some fire starters. Try the best you can to bring your own sleeping bags and pillows because the bed set that you can get from the van rental takes up a LOT of room in the the van.

TIPS FOR VISITING NAPLES FLORIDA  If you are looking for a rainy day activity, there is a great children's museum in Naples called the Golisano. This museum has a lot of fun activities and play areas along with different exhibits to explore. In the same area as the Golisano Museum there is a water park called the Sun-N-Sun Lagoon. The water park has some great waterslides as well as a lazy river, splash pools, activity pool and even just a regular lap pool with a diving board. If you like to watch baseball, both the Boston Red Socks and the Minnesota Twins have spring training facilities in the Fort Myers area. If you are there in February or March you can go to these games! Cirella's is a great family-friendly Italian restauarant. If you are traveling in the winter time it is definitely recommended to make dinner reservations. Iguana Mia is also a great restaurant to visit while in the Naples area. They serves some great Mexican food along with their amazing Margaritas. You can’t miss the large lit up Cactus when driving by on route 41. If you are looking for someplace sweet, be sure to try the Royal Scoop. They create some really interesting flavors of ice cream and offer some crazy sundae combinations.  FAVORITE TRAVEL GEAR Harmony loves to wear Lulu Lemon pants that have lots of pockets along with a sweatshirt. TIP OF THE WEEK Most people don't’ think about this, but you are not supposed to wrap gifts when you are traveling on a plane. TSA may need to inspect them so they may not stay wrapped. Some airports offer a gift wrapping service past the security area. MENTIONED ON THE PODCAST Naples Florida Activities Relaxing in Naples FOLLOW US AND SPREAD THE WORD!

You can reach them by emailing podcast@hawaii-aloha.com or on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. Keep in touch with Hawaii through our Hawaii Vacation Connection podcast!\n\nBruce and Yaling started their weekend off at the Spam Jam in Honolulu, which is the world's largest spam festival, honoring the local, loved flavor of canned spam. It was a great experience with flavorful renditions of spam  dishes such as fajitas, chili and spam flavored macadamia nuts, yummm.\n\nThere's some great news on this podcast, including visitor spending being up 12.7% this year over last year. According to the HTA this is very good news because we're seeing an increase in spending which is always great for Hawaii's economy. Bruce will also illustrate several beaches that are off the beaten path for those looking to explore a more secluded day on the sand.\n\nThis past weekend Bruce and Yaling got to stay at the Halekulani, located on the beach in Waikiki. They really enjoyed House Without a Key, the lounge located right on the property and the live entertainment at this bar. With 453 rooms at the Halekulani, this hotel ranges in height from 2 stories to 17 stories. One of the first 3 hotels first built in Hawaii, this historical property has lush gardens, a pool, 3 cocktail lounges, a fitness center, hospitality suite and so much more.\n\nLastly, you'll hear a few packages that have been booked in the last 24 to 48 hours from hawaii-aloha.com travel agents. Starting off, Bruce details a vacation for 2 people from Orange Country to Honolulu, staying in the Sheraton Waikiki for $2,136. Next, for $6,523 a group of 6 people are traveling from Alabama to Maui in June, staying in a 2-bedroom condo with a mini van rental car. These great deals just keep holding out here in Hawaii so call 1-800-843-8771 to plan your vacation today!",

I know that is a shocker statement and goes against what many people talk about. Cash flow is important and something to consider but I do not believe it is the top priority when building your Lifestyle Asset portfolio. \n.\nI’m a huge believer in Net Worth being the biggest reason we should invest early on and for the long term. Combine that with a positive cash flow and you have a no brainer reason to build a Lifestyle Asset portfolio. \n.\nIf you are only looking for a positive cash flow as you evaluate properties, you will make mistakes. You will be fooled into purchasing cheaper, low quality properties.

It is never a good time to hit the panic button. We will get through this together.\nI’m not at all saying we should not be mindful of any potential risks. We should be mindful of our current reality and follow what the science based advise the CDC is telling us.\nI believe that the current recommendations will help slow the spread of the virus and allow our health care professionals to get ahead of the situation.\nFirst let’s talk about the obvious. The markets are a mess and that is going to affect real estate.\nHow exactly? We don’t know.\nIn the short term people may just wait and see how things shake out.\n",

But how do you take three months off, without affecting your business and profits? Do you buy into the myth of \"outsourcing everything and working just a few hours a week?\" Not really. Instead, you structure your business in a way that enables you to work hard and then take three months off every single year. And Sean walks his talk. Since 2004, he's taken three months off every year (except in 2005, when there was a medical emergency). This podcast isn't about the easy life. It's not some magic trick about working less. Instead with this podcast you learn how to really enjoy your work, enjoy your vacation time and yes, get paid in advance.",

                                "description": "Should you lower your prices? In Part 1 of Persistent Myths of Pricing (And How To Overcome Them), we looked at Myth 1: Ending prices with 7 or 9 (e.g. $97 or $99 instead of $100) Now, let’s look at Myth 2: The Fear of Pricing—You can feel the “right price” in your gut. Should you lower your prices to get greater sales? Listen to this podcast as we explore the second part on the myths of pricing. ================= Imagine you’re in New Zealand right now. And you’re about to jump off a bridge—with a bungee cord, of course. What can you feel in your gut? Yup, fear. But how do you know it’s fear? And more importantly what would you need to do to get rid of the fear? Remember the fear you had when you first rode a bicycle? You probably don’t, but the fear existed. It exists when you’re learning to drive a car, going for a first date, and there’s even a trace of that fear when you first land a new job or show up on vacation in a city you’ve never visited before. The moment you are dealing with the unknown, the fear surges to the surface. And yet you’re on auto pilot if you’re visiting that city for the twentieth time Bicycles don’t scare you as much as they should. And driving to the supermarket while juggling a mobile phone isn’t something you do, but you’ll sneak in a call or text anyway. Pricing brings the same sense of queasiness to our systems And the way we justify it, it by burying the fear. We bring our “woo-woo” systems to the surface and say we’ll know the price is right based on our “gut instinct”. But what if your gut is just good ol’ fear? Because you know it is, don’t you? And the only way we can prove this point is to take something that you own and try to sell it. What’s the gut instinct for selling your house? There’s zero gut instinct in play the moment you have to sell something that is already known. If all the houses in your area are selling at $500,000, would you listen to your gut instinct and sell at $300,000? Never mind that three years ago, you bought the house at a lower price. You still want to sell at $500,000, don’t you? And if you can, you’ll happily accept $550,000 or $600,000. A client of mine used this gut instinct in his business He works hard—much too hard to earn what he’s worth. And the reason why he’s struggling so much, is because his pricing is based on gut instinct. He has to put those products and services on sale, on his website. And when he puts those prices up, he feels like he’s in the middle of New Dehli, and needs to find his hotel. He can’t speak the language and though there are helpful folks around, he’s not quite sure. His brain is racing for a situation that’s a lot less stressful. A vacation closer to home, perhaps. There’s no such thing as “gut instinct” in pricing We’ve used a dartboard to price our products and services for well over 12 years. It’s a method where you put your prices on a dartboard, and you find some darts. Then you throw them on the board. And you have your pricing. If that sounds flippant, well, yes, it is. But it’s a lot less flippant than using your “gut instinct”. ” Take for instance, the cartooning course. We started the course at no charge (if you felt like it, you gift an Amazon voucher). That course was $500 the next year, and today it’s priced at almost $1000 (for about 20 weeks). The Photoshop course (to help you colour your artwork) is just 4 weeks and costs $500. The article writing course goes for 12 weeks and hovers at $3000. The headlines course goes for 10 weeks and costs $800. Want more? “The Brain Audit” has 185 pages and costs $139. The book on “Testimonial Secrets” has 125 pages and costs $45. The same applies for any course, product or service. No matter where you look, there’s no logic to the pricing at all. And yet there’s fear. Every time we’ve raised the prices there’s enormous fear When we raised the price of the Article Writing Course, we moved it from $1,500—to where it is today at $3,000. How do you know how much is too much? When we sold the Protégé course at $10,000, how would we know if it was overpriced or if we were underselling ourselves? The answer lies in fear. You make these price decisions in a vacuum—dart-board style. And this is scary. Even if you’re comparing yourself with the marketplace, the client is not doing the same tour of the marketplace before settling on your product. The only way out of this fear is to keep pushing yourself out of the comfort zone You read about the cartooning course we conducted, right? Why offer it free? My clients already know that I’m a good teacher. They already know I’m a good cartoonist. They also know that they should be paying a substantial fee for something that’s going to take them on a six-month journey. And yet, I was unsure—fearful, even. So yes, you can let the fear get a hold of you. And yes, you can price as low as your “gut” will tell you. But remember, your “gut instinct” is your comfort zone It’s the lowest possible price you can afford to charge. Once you’ve listened to your gut, it’s time to move upwards. Raise your prices bit by bit, or in large chunks. As you get amazing testimonials, get more confident about your ability to deliver, you need to stop looking towards the “gut” and start looking up at the dart board. And yes, this brings us full circle to our summary Myth 1: Ending prices with 7 or 9 (e.g. $97 or $99 instead of $100). There’s no basis for this crazy figures. Use whatever you like. Myth 2: You can feel the “right price” in your gut. Nope. You never could. That’s just fear talking. And once you’ve sold a product or service at a higher price, you’ll feel the price is just right—until you have to raise the prices again. Raise it anyway. You know how you had to suffer wearing those coats because your parents thought you’d get a cold? Well, the same suffering can bring you down with myths in pricing. Stay clear of the myths, and you’ll find that you can get better prices for your products and services every single time.

                                "description": "Is resistance a game? It can feel a bit like that when you're almost always on the losing team. But often the reason why we lose to resistance is because we don't realise how the brain works. And this brain stuff was studied by researchers at the University of Cincinnati. What they found was astounding. In just over 10 minutes, our brains start to waver and we lose focus. So how can we make sure we don't give in to resistance? Find out in Part 2 of the Resistance game. ============== Imagine you had two loans to pay back Loan A was $100,000 at 19% interest per annum. Loan B was $200 at 1% interest. Which loan would you pay back first? Loan A or Loan B? If you chose Loan A, then almost every financial consultant on the planet would agree with you. Except Dave Ramsey To everyone, but Dave, the logic is clear. Loan A has a much higher rate of interest. Logically you should pay back the higher rate of interest first. But as you’d expect, Dave disagrees. That’s because Dave understands inertia better than most other financial consultants So what is inertia? I learned a funny definition in physics class at school. It went like this: A body in the state of rest or motion is inertia. Hah, that made me laugh. How can you be stuck and moving, and still be in the same state? But apparently that’s how inertia works. And this is Dave’s advice to people who are struggling with debt. First list all the debts on a piece of paper All debts need to go down. Student loans, credit card, mortgage, blah, blah. Then you need to rearrange the loans based on the size of the loan. So the smallest loan goes right at the top and the biggest one right at the bottom. And everything else in between (depending on the size of the loan). And then he instructs you to pay only the minimum payment on every debt–with one exception. After the minimum payments were made, every available dollar needs to be put towards the first debt on the list. Incredible as it may sound, Dave is telling you to wipe out that tiny, itty-bitty $200 debt with the pathetic interest, instead of taking on the painful big amount/big interest debt. Logically it makes no sense But your brain doesn’t always work logically when it comes to inertia. While you’re lounging on the sofa, watching endless and pointless political debates on TV, your logic is telling to get off your butt. It’s telling you that the debates are endless (and did we say, pointless?). Your logic is also telling you that you should be doing some work or exercise instead of engaging in mindless drivel. So logic doesn’t work. And the same applies to the debt. When Dave’s clients wipe out the first debt it’s not necessarily logical, but it creates a factor of momentum. First the $200 is wiped out. Then the $350. Then the $800. And so on, right up to the ‘monsta’ $100,000. The motion is what matters A body in a state of rest or motion is inertia. And going from rest to a state of motion is impossible if you decide to take on the biggest task first. Logic tells you that you should fix your website right now. Logic tells you that you should write that 300 page book. But Dave would say, “Go brush your teeth first.” That simple act of doing something–anything at all–gets you off your caboose and into another state of inertia: a state of motion. So if you need to get something done, fool yourself -Don’t go for a 60 minute walk. Instead put on your shoes and decide to walk for just 7 minutes. -Don’t try to write a complete article. Just write for 14 minutes. Then stop. -Avoid trying to clean the entire bathroom. Just attack the sink. These tiny bits help you get to the bigger bits. Because even as you go for the 7 minute walk, you know very well that you’re not going to turn around in 7 minutes. You’ll go longer and further. But the goal always needs to be 7 minutes or 14 minutes or the $200 debt. The itty-bitty bits are important, more important in fact, than the bigger goals. When people say they feel inertia, they mostly refer to a state of laziness Of not wanting to do anything at all. But as my physics teacher would tell you: “There’s inertia and there’s inertia.” And to get from one stage to another, you need to make the list in descending order of importance. Then attack the list. And as Dave would say: Start small. Acknowledgements Dave Ramsey’s ‘Snowball Debt’ and ‘Switch’ by Chip and Dan Heath. P.S. Yes I know. You’re headed to Google these names, aren’t you? You think you’ll find out more about this book and this method of reducing debt, aren’t you? But you already have the tools. You have a piece of paper. You have a pencil or pen. And you have the methodology. So don’t muck around. Get to work. You need to change that state of inertia right now.

Useful Resources and Links Dart Board Pricing: How To Increase Prices (Without Losing Customers) The Headline Report: Why Headlines Fail The 70% Principle: Why It Knocks Procrastination Out of the Ball Park  ------------------------------------- Back in the year 2003  I wrote an article where you just had to take three steps to write a great headline. You could test the headline and you could find out in minutes that it worked for you, and it also got the attention of your customers. I wasn’t prepared for how popular that article would be. As we were looking at the statistics of the Psychotactics site, we saw that the article got picked up over and over again. Then we decided, let’s make this a report. Surprisingly, when I took that same article, which was just about 800 words, and I put it into a PDF and put some graphics and an introduction and some cartoons, it became close to a ten-page book. That is the headline report. This is the interesting part. The report was nothing more than an article. Can we all do the same? Can we just write an 800-word article, put it in a report, and make it powerful? Not quite. You have to understand why the report works. We’re going to break up that headline report here today on this podcast. You’ll see for yourself, there are three elements that make it work. Let’s explore those three elements. What makes the report so powerful? The key factor is not the elements but the overall concept. The overall concept is one of empowerment. We are so hung up on the concept of information that we forget what we really have to do as teachers. As teachers we have to empower. We know we’ve done our job correctly when the client is able to do exactly what we’re doing, and possibly even better. Frankly, when I was writing the headline report I wasn’t thinking of this. I wasn’t thinking of empowerment. I wasn’t thinking of the elements. But when you deconstruct the report you can see there are three very specific elements that make it that empowerment tool. The first of the elements is tiny increments. The second is the length. The third are the examples in the report. Let’s explore each one systematically. Let’s start off with the first one, which is the tiny increments. What are tiny increments? About a month ago I got myself some recording hardware. It has all these buttons and it’s very hard to figure out which button to press and when to press it. Of course you don’t want to look at the manual because that’s really badly written. Maybe you go online like I did and you go to YouTube. There are lots of tutorials on how to use it, but there is all this unboxing and then something else and something else. 35 minutes later, you have no clue what you’re supposed to do. Then I found a video that was only three minutes long. The video only covered turning on the device. Now, it was three minutes long. How much can you learn about turning on a device? It’s a little switch. But it was so cool. I could actually do it. It was a tiny increment. You don’t have to put in a ton of information for people to be impressed. You have to empower. At the end of the video, what could I do? I could turn on the device. So I go to the next video. In the next video, they cover a little bit again. This is the concept of tiny increments. When we’re teaching, we don’t understand that the client doesn’t get what we’re saying. Let’s say you’ve come to one of the Psychotactics workshops and we’re doing an experiment. We’re saying we’re going to take steps now. I say, “Okay, let’s take a step.” Then you watch the people in the room. What do they do? Almost everyone will take a step forward, but someone will take a step to the left, or someone will take a step to the right, or someone will take a step back. Now we have all these permutations where people are going off-tangent. If they just take one step, they just make one mistake, you can pull them back and then say, “What I meant was take a step to the left.” Now the whole group can go one step back, one step to the left, and now we’re on target. When you have something that has a very tiny increment, the customer can only make a very small mistake. You can spot the mistake and pull them back, or you can show them that mistake in your report and pull them back. When you have this wealth of information, all these buttons to press and all these things to do all at once, suddenly the customer is lost. When they’re lost, they’re intimidated, and intimidation doesn’t create a safe zone, and when you don’t create a safe zone then of course you don’t get empowerment. The first factor you have to look at when you look at the headline report is this concept of tiny increments. You only have to take a very tiny step to get from point A to point B. When you’ve taken that step, you can go from point B to point C. This is what struck me when I stepped into an Apple store many years ago. It’s one of the reasons why I bought an Apple even though I’d been using a PC for ages. When I got into the store, I just had to do one thing. That one thing led to the next thing, and that next thing led to the next thing. This is very cool. You see it on the iPad where you just have to press a little button, and that one thing leads to the next thing. This is the concept of tiny increments. You see this in the headline report. It’s what you’ve got to do in your report: just one little step. Now this takes us to the second one, which is the concept of length. Length really helps in empowerment. Every time I speak to someone about this podcast, I will say, “The podcast is only about 15 to 20 minutes long.” But what if were to say, “It’s only two to three hours long’? There would be a very clear difference. When you say 15 to 20 minutes long people think, “I could go for a little walk and I could listen to the podcast.” This principle of length is critical, especially when a customer doesn’t know you that well and you have to get your message across without going crazy on them. It has helped me when I was trying to work out that audio hardware. I just had to deal with three minutes, and then after that the next three minutes, and then the next three minutes. Every one of those three-minute capsules, they empowered me. They moved me forward. The headline report does this in a really fascinating way. It moves youforward. Within ten pages, you’re done. Now the question arises: Is that it? Is that all you could write about headlines? No, of course not. You could write 300 pages or 500 pages. There is a wealth of information in the world of headlines. But do you have to put in the report? The core of empowerment is simply one of length. When there is not too much of it, someone is able to consume it. Once they’re able to consume it, you have empowered them. You know that because you can get them to teach you what you’ve just taught them and they will do that spectacularly well. We take the first concept, which is tiny increments, and we take the second concept, which is length, and that leaves us with just the third one. What is the third concept? The third concept is simply one of examples and case studies. When you listen to this podcast, you got a whole bunch of examples about the recording device and how I had to fiddle with it. You also got the example of how the iPad worked, and of course my visit to the Apple store for the first time in 2008. Those were examples. Why were those examples there? They weren’t just random stuff. For one thing, the example lowers that intimidation factor. Immediately you’re taken on a little side journey, a little detour. That helps you to focus on the idea, but it also helps you understand the concept in greater detail. When you look at the headline report you’ll find that there is an example of how the headline is being built stage by stage. If all you had was a concept of how to write a headline without the example it would be so much more dreary and harder to achieve the same result. As a teacher, that’s your goal. Your goal is to empower. Examples empower. Case studies empower. Stories empower. Go down that path and put it in your report. Whether you’re reading The Brain Audit, or Pricing,or any book, you will find that we use this concept. That’s what clients read and go, “Wow, I should delve more into this stuff.” The biggest problem that we have is we know too much. We try to put all that too much into our reports, into our books, into our presentations. Does it empower? It’s easy to give information. A lot of people are giving a lot of information. It’s all stuff coming at you left, right, and center, and you don’t know where to go. Your client doesn’t know where to go either. Have this little guiding light of empowerment and everything changes. We started out with a report. We started out with just a little article, but that article had steps, and it went from one step to another to another. When it got into the report stage it was clearer because of the graphics, because of the layout. That’s how you should go about writing your report. Think about empowerment and think about the three things that we’ve covered today. The first thing that we covered today was tiny increments. Remember that even if you say take one step, people can steps in all directions, show you take very tiny steps. The second thing is one of length. A three-hour podcast, a 300-page report, very interesting but no one’s going to read it. You want to keep it simple. You want to keep it within ten or 12 pages. Finally, you want to reduce that intimidation factor. It’s very hard to understand the new concept. Having examples, having stories, having case studies, this really makes it easier for me to figure out what you’re saying. Which brings us to the end of this podcast. What is the one thing that you can do? I think the one thing that you should do is to just boil it down to three things. You’ve seen how this podcast just covers three elements. If I wanted to write a book on how to create a great report, I could write 200 pages. But this podcast, it’s a report. It’s just got three points, three simple points, and you’ve been empowered. I think you should do the same. Just jot down three points. I know there are 700 points on the topic. Just focus on three and you’ll have a report that someone actually consumes. Now isn’t that a novel idea? What have we been doing in the past six weeks or so? If you’ve been following this podcast, you know that we went off to Washington D.C. to have the information products workshop. It’s just 25-30 people in a room. Everyone gets to know each other. Everyone works with each other. It’s an amazing event. We don’t do the Psychotactics workshops very often, so if you ever get a chance to get to a Psychotactics workshop, you should come. It’s empowerment at its very best. You’ll see it at the workshop. From there we flew to Denver and I presented at the Opera House in Denver and lost my voice, got it back, struggled through the whole episode. My wife gave me an eight on ten. She has given me a -2 in the past, so I think I did a pretty good job. That comes down to practice and getting all your act together. During the event, some things went wrong for speakers. The video didn’t show up at the right time, or it didn’t sync with the audio. The way to solve this problem is to do all of the groundwork. I was there a few days in advance, getting over the tiredness factor, making sure that I knew the length of the stage, looking for any light distractions. Because when you’re on a stage a lot of lights hit you, especially on a stage of that size. You need to know where you need to stop before light hits you in the face and you can’t see a thing. You also need to speak to the audio and the video people, because they recommended stuff to me that ensured our whole presentation was absolutely flawless. There’s a lot of background stuff that you have to do, and that marks you out as a professional. I was completely hampered on stage there. I was sniffling and I could barely speak, but that eight on ten, that was because of all the groundwork that went before. As much as I would have liked to get full marks from my wife, at least I was able to struggle to an eight. You know it goes well because when you step out of the auditorium, people come up to you and go, “I’m going to make this fix today. I’m going to make this change today.” You have empowered them. Once we finished with all of the work and the presentations, we went on to Sardinia. We had a great time. Sardinia is this big island off Italy. You’ve probably heard of Sicily. If you look to the left, there is Sardinia. The food is absolutely stunning. We go on vacations because of the food. We really don’t care that much about the monuments. The food has to be good. We gorged a lot and we walked a lot of slopes. That’s how we keep our weight in check. Three weeks in Sardinia, a stopover in San Francisco, and now we’re back in New Zealand. I have to admit it’s been hard getting back to work, even though it’s been a week. This nasty cough that started in Washington D.C. followed me through Denver, through Sardinia, through San Francisco. It’s okay now but it’s been a long run. Nonetheless, it was worth doing the info products course in Washington D.C.. If you missed that, then I would strongly suggest that you get the home study. It’s not cheap but it helps you construct that book. You go from this report and you can create audio, video or webinars, but not just any old webinar or any audio or book, but stuff that empowers and empowers in a big way. You can find that in the product section of the Psychotactics site. If you’re not looking for something quite that big, you might want to check out Dartboard Pricing, because if nothing else you want to increase your prices without losing customers. You can find that at psychotactics.com/ttc. If on the other hand you want to send me a message, I’m at @SeanD’Souza on Twitter, Sean D’Souza on Facebook, and of course on Psychotactics at sean@psychotactics.com.

If you do, let us know and we’ll be sure to fix them.”  This is the Three-Month Vacation. I’m Sean D’Souza. Doug Hitchcock was my first real mentor and he had been bankrupt thrive. When I first moved to Auckland in the year 2000, I didn’t really know anyone. I was starting up a new business, I was starting up a new life. I joined a networking group and within that networking group I asked for a mentor. Well, no one in the networking group was willing to be a mentor, but someone did put me in touch with Doug. The only problem with Doug was he had been bankrupt thrive. Now, when I say he was bankrupt thrice, it doesn’t mean he was still bankrupt. He just pulled himself out of the hole three times in his life and there he was, at about 70 plus, and he was my first mentor. Before he starts to talk to me about anything, he asks me, “Do you do goal setting?” I’m like, “Yeah, I have goals,” and he goes, “No. Do you have goals on paper?” I said, “No.” He says, “We have to start there. We have to start with goals on paper.” That’s how I started doing goal setting, all the way back in the year 2000. Almost immediately, I got all the goal setting wrong. You ask, how can you get goal setting wrong? After all, you’re just putting goals down on a sheet of paper. How can you get something like that wrong? You can’t write the wrong goals, but you can write too many goals. That’s exactly what I did. I sat down with that sheet of paper and I wrote down all my work goals, my personal goals, and I had an enormous list. That’s when Doug came back into the scene, and he said, “Pick three.” I said, “I could pick five.” He goes, “No, no, no. Pick three.” I picked three goals in my work and three goals from my personal life. You know what? By the end of the year, I’d achieved those goals. Ever since, I have been sitting down and working out these goals based on Doug’s method. Doug may have lost his business thrice in a row, but he knew what he was talking about. Most of us just wander through life expecting things to happen. When they happen, we say they happen for a reason, but they don’t happen for a reason. They happen, and we assign a reason to it. In this episode, I’m going to cover three topics. The first is the three part planning. Then we’ll go the other way. We’re create a stop doing list. Finally, we’ll look at benchmarks and see how we’ve done in the year. Let’s start off with the first one, which is the three part planning. Does the San Fernando earthquake ring any bells in your memory? Most people haven’t ever heard of this earthquake, and yet it was one of the deadliest earthquakes in US history. It collapsed entire hospitals, it killed 64 people, it injured over two and a half thousand. When the damage was assessed, it had cost millions of dollars, and yet it could have been the disaster that eclipsed all other US disasters. That’s because the earthquake almost caused the entire Van Norman Reservoir to collapse. The dam held, and yet, if it had collapsed, the resulting rush of water would have taken the lives of more people than the Pearl Harbor Attack, the 1906 San Francisco Earthquake, 9/11 and 1900 Galveston Hurricane combined. In barely 12 seconds, the top section of the dam had disintegrated and yet, the surrounding areas were extremely lucky. The reservoir was only half full that day. The aftershocks of the earthquake continued to cause parts of the dam to break apart. A few feet of free board was the only thing that stopped a total collapse. This total collapse is what many of us come close to experiencing as we try to clamber up the ladder of success. We try to do too many things and we don’t seem to go anywhere. In effect, this is like water cascading down a dam. There’s too many things and we have no control over it. What’s going to stop it? The only thing that seems to stop anything is some kind of focus and goal setting is focus. The way we go about our goal setting is the way Doug showed me. The first category of goal setting is what we want to achieve at work. The second set comprises of our personal goals. The third, this is the most critical of all, what we’re going to learn. Should we start off with the first one, which is our work goals? Well, that’s not the way we do it as Psychotactics. The way we work at Psychotactics is we look at our personal goals. Our own lives are far more important than work. What we do is we sit down, and first, we plan vacations. As you know, we take three months off. We’ve been doing this since 2004. We started our business at the end of 2002. Yet by 2004, we had decided we were going to take three months off. The thing is that your vacations also need planning. Our vacations are broken up into big breaks, small breaks, and weekends. Now the big breaks are the month long vacations, and then the small breaks are in between that. We’re go away for a couple of days somewhere, and that’s our small break. I’m saying weekends, because before I wouldn’t take weekends off. I’d be working on the weekend at least for a few hours on Saturday morning and a few hours on Sunday morning, and I don’t do that any more. Now that’s almost written in stone. It’s very hard for me to get to work on weekends. I’ll slide sometimes, but it’s very hard. The most critical thing to do is to work out the long breaks. When are we going to have those, and then the shorter breaks. That comprises that whole vacation concept, but you also have to have other personal goals. Maybe I want to learn how to cook Mexican dishes, or maybe I want to learn how to take better photographs. Now, these are personal projects. They’re not not pseudo work projects. They’re things that, at the end of the year, I go, “Wow, that’s what I’ve achieved. That’s how much I progressed.” That’s how you start off with personal goals. You plan your breaks. You plan what you want to do personally. Once you’re done with that, then you go to your work goals. We have a lot of work goals, we have the article writing workshop coming up, we’ve got the 50 words workshop, which is, how do you start up an article. We’ve got a whole bunch of things, because we’ve got products, we’ve got courses, we’ve got workshops. All of this has to sit nicely between, so that we work for 12 weeks and then we go on a break. We’ve decided that we’re not having any workshops next year. We’ve had a lot of workshops this year, no workshops next year. Now, this leaves us the chance to focus on the courses and the products. Now my brain is like that dam, there’s always water rushing over. I want to do a million projects, but then I have to choose. The article writing course is one of the things that I want to do for sure. I want to do a version 2.0 of it. The cartoon bank, I’ve been putting that off for a long time. That’s definitely something I want to do. Then I’ll pick a third one. Do I stop at three? No, but I make sure that I get these three down. The three that I’m going to do, they go down on paper. Some other projects will come up, a lot of stuff that I might not expect, and yet I’ll get all of this done, but these three, they’ll get done. Those three vacations, they will get done. Then we get to the third part, which is learning. What am I going to learn this next year? Maybe I’ll learn a software, or maybe I’ll learn how to use audio better. The point is, I have to write it down, because once I write it down, then I’m going to figure out where I have to go and what I have to do to make sure that learning happens. This is not just learning like reading some books or doing something minor like that. This is big chunks of learning, so that by the the end of the year, I know I’ve reached that point. When it comes to planning, the first thing that we’re always doing is we’re looking at these three elements, which is work, vacation, and learning. If we have to do other sub projects, we’ll do it, but these nine things get done. Year after year after year. This is what Doug taught me, he gave me this ability to focus. I consider myself to be unfocused, I consider myself to want to do everything and anything. That was the gift of Doug. In the year 2008, we had a program, it was a year long program. You probably heard of it. It was called a Psychotactics Protégé program. We would teach clients how to write articles, how to create info products, public relations. Lots of things along the way in that year. As you’d expect, it was reasonably profitable. 15 students paid $10,000, and so that was $150,000 that we would have in the bank before the year started. In 2009, we pulled the plug on the Protégé system. Why would we do that? We started it in 2006, it was full, in 2007 it was full, in 2008 it was full, in 2009 there was a waiting list. We decided not to go ahead with it. We decided it was going to go on our stop doing list. We were going to walk away from $150,000, just like that. Yes, some clients were unhappy, because they wanted to be on the next Protégé program. They had seen the testimonials, they had seen the results. They knew that it was good enough to sign up for. They knew that $10,000 was a very small investment, for a year long advancement. On our part, we realized that we had to walk away from $150,000 that we were getting on cue, every December. This is what’s called a stop doing list. We’ve used this stop doing list in our own lives. When we left India, and got to Auckland, it wasn’t like we were leaving something desperate. We were leaving something that was really good. I was drawing tattoos all day, going bowling in the afternoon, having long lunches, Renuka’s company was doing really well. They were picking up all expenses, and the only thing we really had to pay for was food but, at that point in time, we decided we had to make a break. We had to stop doing something so that we could do something different. We don’t know whether that different is better, but at that point we have to stop it, so that we can explore what is coming up ahead. There are two things that you put on your stop doing list. One, something that is working exceedingly well. The second thing, something that’s doing really badly. Or something that’s getting in your way. Now, the first one doesn’t make any sense. If something is doing exceedingly well, why would you stop it? Well, the point is that if you continue to do something, then you can’t do something else. You don’t know how good that something is until you stop doing it and then you go on to do something else. Last night, I was reading The New Yorker, and The New Yorker is one of my favorite magazines. There’s James Surowiecki saying exactly the same thing. He’s saying that Time Warner should sell HBO. HBO has now 120 million subscribers globally. It has earned over 2 billion dollars in profits last year. It’s stand alone streaming service has got over a million new subscribers since last spring. What does the article recommend? It recommends that they get rid of it, they sell it, they get the best price for it at this point of time, when they’re doing so well. What if it doubles in its value? That’s the answer we’ll never know, but the article went on. It talked about ESPN and how in 2014 it was worth 50 billion dollars. Disney owned it, they should have sold it, they could have banked the money. They could have focused on something else, but no, they kept it. ESPN is still doing well, it’s still the dominant player, but you can see that it’s not exactly where it was in 2014. The Protégé program was doing really well for us, clients were with us for the whole year. They would then join 5000 BC, we’d get to meet them. It was a lot of fun, and it generated a sizable revenue and we walked away from it. It enabled us to do other stuff that we would not have been able to do. When you say stop doing list, it’s not just the bad stuff that you have to stop doing. Sometimes you have to stop doing the things that are very critical, like next year we’re not doing workshops. Workshops are very critical to our business, but we’re not going to do the workshops. Instead, we’ll do online courses. Instead, we’ll do something else. We’ll create that space for ourselves, even though the workshops are doing really well. The other side of the stop doing list is stuff that’s driving you crazy. You know it’s driving you crazy, but you’re not stopping it. For instance, in September of this year, we started rebuilding the Psychotactic site. Now, there are dozens of pages on the Psychotactic site and I want to fiddle around with every single one of them, and do things that are interesting, different. The problem is that there are other projects, like for instance the storytelling workshop. Of course, vacations that get in the way. The point is that, at some point, you have to say, okay, I really want to do this, but I’m not going to do this. I’m going to put it off until later. This is procrastination, but it is part of a stop doing list. You can’t do everything in the same time. Last year, this time, we had the same dilemma when we were going to do the podcasts. I wanted to write some books for Amazon, and I wanted to do the podcast. Every day, we would go for a walk, and it would run me crazy. I didn’t know where to start, when to start, what to do first. I had to sit down and go, okay, what am I going to stop? I just dumped the Amazon books and started on the podcast. Now we’re on podcast number 70, and it’s not even been 52 weeks. It shows you how that stop doing list can help you focus and get stuff out of the way. Sometimes you have to procrastinate to get that point. Now the stop doing list is not restricted to work alone. You can take it into your personal life as well. For instance, I used to get my hair cut by a hairdresser, and I was dissatisfied for a very long time. You come back in, you grumble, and my wife, Renuka, she said, “Okay, stop grumbling. Go and find another hairdresser.” I ran into Shay, now Shay was cutting my hair so well, it was amazing. I wasn’t the only one who thought that was amazing. Usually, I was on a waiting list at a barber shop. I would get there, and there were two people in front of me, waiting for Shay. While a few of the barbers just stood around, doing absolutely nothing because no one was interested. Then, one day, involuntarily, Shay went onto my stop doing list. Kimmy was around and Shay wasn’t and so Kimmy cut my hair. She was better than Shay. I thought, “Oh my goodness. I should have done this a long time ago.” Then Kimmy got transferred to another branch, and now there’s Francis. You’ve heard about Francis in other podcasts. Now Francis is my top guy. There you go, even in something as mundane as cutting hair, there is a stop doing list. You have to push yourself a bit, and at other times you have to pull back and go, “No, we’re not going to do that.” The stop doing list is for good times, as well as for pressurized times. You have to decide, I’m going to stop doing it, I’m going to move onto the next thing. This takes us to the third part of planning, which is benchmarks. Now what are benchmarks? Often when we set out to do a project, say we’re going to do that website. What we don’t do is we don’t write down all the elements that are involved in doing that website because a website can go on forever, can’t it? It expands exponentially. When you are saying, I am going to write books for Amazon. Well, how many books are you going to write? How many pages are the books going to be? What’s the time frame? Where are you going to get the cartoons from? Who’s going to do all the layout? Having this kind of benchmark in mind makes a big difference. When we plan for something, for instance if I’m planning for the article writing course, which is version 2.0. I’m going to have to sit down and work out what I’m going to have to do. When I’m doing the stock cartoons, I’m going to have to sit down and work out what kind of stock cartoons, how many. It’s perfectly fine to write a top level goal. You should do that, you should say, “Okay, I’m going to do the website,” but then you have to get granular. The granular bit tells you, have I reached my destination. Otherwise, people don’t get to their goals, and that’s why they’re struggling, because there’s no clarity. Usually, you’re going to get the clarity when you have only three things to do, but even so, if you don’t have benchmarks you’ll never know when you’re reaching your goal or if you’re going to reach your goal. That brings us to the end of this episode. Summary What did we cover? We looked at three sets of goal setting, and that is your personal goal setting, your work goal setting, and your learning goal setting. Instead of having 700 of them, you just have three things that you want to achieve in the year. Three major things that you want to achieve in the year. Logically, you start with the work, but don’t handle the work. Just go to the breaks. Organize your breaks first, because you get reinvigorated and you come back and then you can do better work. First, fix the breaks and then go to the work, then go the learning. That takes care of the first set. The second thing that you want to do is you want to make sure that you have a stop doing list. Sometimes, things are working, they’re going your way, and they still have to be dropped. That’s what we did with the Protégé program, that’s what we did with our move to New Zealand, and a lot of good things have become better, because we’ve decided to move along. Sometimes, you’re just confused because you have too many things to do, and procrastinate. Go ahead. I mean, I know this about planning, not procrastination, but procrastination is a form of planning, when you have too much to do. Finally, have the benchmarks. Make your goals a little more detailed so that you know when you’re hitting those benchmarks. Plan it in a little more detail. That’s how you’ll reach your goal. This is what goal setting is about. It’s very simple. People make it more complicated than it needs to be. What’s the one thing that you can do today? Very simple. Work, vacation, and learning. Get your paper out, get your pen, and start writing. Three goals. You can start off with seven, or ten, but whittle it down to three. Oh, and make sure you write it down. When you write it down, things happen. It’s like magic when you write it down. Keep it in your head, it’s not as powerful. Write it down, it happens. If one of your goals is to join 5000 BC this year. That’s 5000 BC, our membership site. You’ll find that it’s quite a nice place to be. It’s a very warm and friendly place. It would be great to see you there. It also gives you the opportunity to be first in line for any of the online courses that we’re having. That might not seem like a big deal until you see how cool the online courses are at Psychotactics. It’s not just another information dump, you actually get the skill. If you set out to be a cartoonist, you become a cartoonist. If you set out to be a writer, you become a writer. It’s not just information that you’re getting, it’s all very practical. Being a member of 5000 BC gives you that little edge to get in there before everybody else. You have to read The Brain Audit, however. You can get that at psychotactics.com/brainaudit or on amazon. Com. If you’ve read The Brain Audit and you would like a special collector’s edition, then email us at Psychoanalytical. We’ll give you instruction on how to get the special collector’s edition. That’s it from me at Psychotactics and the Three Month Vacation. Bye for now. One of the biggest reasons why we struggle with our learning is because we run into resistance. Resistance is often just seen as a form of laziness, but that is not true at all. There are hidden forces causing us all to resist doing what we really should do. This slows us down considerably.

                                "description": "How do you make your product or service irresistible? With tens of thousands of similar products or services in the market, can you use simple techniques to create a great offer? This episode shows you two psychological methods that we can't turn down?as humans. We love both the buffet and the specialty. No matter if you're a small business or a big one, you can use these techniques and increase your product and service sales.  In this episode Sean talks about Part 1: Buffet vs. Specialty Principle Part 2: How Studio 54 put out a buffet of fantasy Part 3: What does this mean for you when you’re selling a product or service?

No matter where you go on the planet, people know of you. Doors open magically for you. People can’t help but gape in wonder as you show up at an event. So imagine a place where the great Frank Sinatra can’t enter. It’s inconceivable, isn’t it? And yet it happened. When Frank showed up at Studio 54, he was turned away. So was the president of Cyprus, the King of Saudi Arabia’s son, Roberta Flack, and several young Kennedys. Even the famous movie star, Jack Nicholson was unable to enter on opening night. Studio 54 was like no other place in New York From the moment it opened its 11,000-square-foot dance floor, it was packed with celebrities dying to get in. Olivia Newton-John, Michael Jackson, Woody Allen, Andy Warhol, Elizabeth Taylor, Dolly Parton, Mick Jagger, Tine Turner—you get the idea—they were just some of the visitors to Studio 54. Almost every night since it opened its doors on April 26, 1977, it was packed to its capacity—almost 2000 people a night. If you considered yourself cool, you wanted to get into Studio 54—but there was no guarantee you’d get in. There was someone stopping the flow… This someone was at the door Studio 54 night after night. He’d show up at the door at 11:30 pm and get on a step stool above the crowd. He’d pick who could get into the club that night—and who was to be turned away. His name is Steve Rubell, part-owner and the person who made sure the Studio was one of the most irresistible places in New York! So what made Studio 54 so irresistible, when there were so many cool places in New York at the time? And what makes any product or service irresistible, even without star power? Let’s take a look at three core elements.  Buffet vs. Specialty Exclusivity Build Up    Buffet vs. Specialty Principle If you were to go to Lynda.com you’d be faced with a buffet. On Lynda.com there are hundreds of tutorials on software, business and creative skills. In 2004 alone, there were over 100 courses on the site. And that course number has gone up exponentially. For the past few years, Lynda.com been adding more than 18 hours of content, almost every single day of the year. That means you’re likely to run into thousands of hours of tutorials topics such as Photoshop, computer animation, 3-D animation, photography—in all about 224,413 tutorials to date. That’s a huge buffet, don’t you agree? And as humans, we’re primed for buffets. We love the “eat all you want” concept and it’s even better if the “food” is of an extremely high quality. This means that a potential client of Lynda.com can access all their content for just $250 a year. Immediately you see why this kind of deal is incredibly irresistible. If you decide to learn a program like InDesign, you can easily do so, because there are at least a dozen courses on InDesign alone. If you want to learn to work with WordPress, hey, there’s a mountain of video instruction already in place. No matter where you look, the volume and quality of content tantalises you. Which brings us to our first principle—the buffet principle If you’re offering your clients an enormous amount of something, they’re instantly drawn towards it, whether they can consume it or not. When given a buffet option, few of us can stop ourselves from feeling the need to buy the product or service. When you look at 5000bc.com, you get a buffet option 5000bc is the membership site at Psychotactics.com. The moment you get to the sales page at 5000bc, there’s a feeling of a ton of information at 5000bc. There are cumulatively, hundreds of articles on topics such as copywriting, web design, branding, lead generation etc. Which is why most clients tend to sign up to the membership site at 5000bc. It’s more than likely they’ve been a subscriber at Psychotactics for a while, bought and read The Brain Audit, possibly even bought some other books from Psychotactics—and then they’re exposed to 5000bc. And the buffet concept kicks in. At $259 a year (remarkably similar to Lynda.com), clients can get not only a ton of curated content, but also have the opportunity to ask me dozens of questions—some of which are answered within hours, if not minutes. This concept of a buffet becomes impossible to resist, and has been the main factor in attracting clients to 5000bc since it started way back in 2003. Studio 54 put out a buffet of fantasy The magazine, Vanity Fair, describes it as the “giddy epicenter of 70s hedonism, a disco hothouse of beautiful people, endless cocaine and every kind of sex. Once you were within the velvet ropes, you were exposed to raunchiness, debauchery and creativity of an unimaginable scale. “It felt like you were going to a new place every night,” says Kevin Haley, then a model, now a Hollywood decorator. “And you were, because they changed it all the time for the parties. Remember the Dolly Parton party? It was like a little farm with bales of hay and live farm animals—pigs and goats and sheep. The designer Karl Lagerfield’s party: an 18th century paty with busboys dressed up as courtiers, powdered wigs and then—a live reggae concert at 3 am in the morning. Another night might bring Bianca Jagger popping out of a birthday cake. Some nights might bring in a sea of glitter, another night Lady Godiva on a horse—or Hell’s Angels on Harleys on the dance floor. Ironically, the buffet-concept represents just one way to create an irresistible offer. The other way is the exact opposite—where you take away everything and create a specialty offer. Remember Lynda.com where you get over 200,000 tutorials? Remember the price? Yes, it’s $250 a year. And yet, at Psychotactics we sell an InDesign course that’s $269. It’s not an entire course in InDesign. It’s not even a partial course. All the course promises is ONE thing. It shows you how to create an e-book in InDesign in less than an hour. If you were to learn a course in InDesign, you’re likely to take at least 18 hours—and that’s the first time around. It’s likely you’d have to go through the entire course (or at least part of the course) a second time. And then when you’re ready to create your snazzy e-book, you have to work out which part of InDesign will help you get the result you seek. It’s not inconceivable to spend 40-50 hours just to get your e-book going. Now the specialty offer makes a huge difference to the client Instead of wading through hours of material, they get right to the point. And this specialty concept applies to more than just courses or training. A phone. Most of us want smartphones that have all the bells and whistles. But what if you want just a cell phone that makes calls? The Doro Phone Easy 626 does just what you’d expect a cell phone to do—it makes calls. Like the InDesign course, it’s not meant for everyone, but just a smaller audience that finds it irresistible. What does this mean for you when you’re selling a product or service? It means you can have your cake and eat it too. When we sell the book, The Brain Audit, it is akin to a buffet (like most books). It has several chapters and spans 180 pages. Yet, elements of The Brain Audit are then isolated. For instance, one of the elements, uniqueness, is a complete course. Another element, testimonial is a 100+ page book. Clients who buy The Brain Audit are extremely satisfied with the content and applications. However, when they want to go deeper on an isolated topic, they will buy the other products as well. Studio 54 catered to almost 2000 people a night—yet there was isolation in place If you were part of the select few, you could go down to the basement. The basement was essentially a storage area connected by zigzagging passageways. The in-crowd was in the basement, away from the party upstairs, mostly talking through the night and drinking bottles of a vodka brand— Stolichnaya. Even if you’re no Studio 54, you can have a smörgåsbord of goodies while at the same time putting a velvet rope over other product or services. And since we’re talking about buffets, a restaurant could have the buffet, while at the same time offering a special meal for just a tiny audience. A website designer could put together a website with all the bells and whistles—then create a service or product that was very niche and hence, irresistible. To be irresistible, you don’t have to choose between buffet and specialty items In reality a specialty item is easier to put together (because it’s less stuff, rather than more). In the grand scheme of things, it’s also easier to market as it has a clear point of focus. While we’ll look at all three elements: buffet/specialty, exclusivity and build up, it’s important to note that specialty is a great starting point. So start small—and charge more. This takes us to the second element: Exclusivity. Have a look here—for the continuation on How To Make Your Product or Service Irresistible: Part 2 and 3.",

                                "description": "Success is good. Focus is good. Until it’s bad. Incredible as it may seem, focus can cause a massive blindspot in our business. So what’s the option? Surely it can’t be distraction? Actually it’s a mix of both that’s required. Using the concept of “spinning plates”, you can avoid the blind spot of success and the mindlessness of distraction. ----------------------------- Right click here and ‘save as’ to download this episode to your computer.  Once upon a time in New York’s Catskill Mountains lived a man called Rip Van Winkle. You’ve probably heard of this story. I heard it when I was a kid. I’ve kind of forgotten what the story was all about. As the story goes, one autumn day he wants to escape from his wife’s nagging so he wonders up the mountain with his dog. He hears his name being called out. He sees a man with antiquated Dutch clothing. This man is carrying a keg up the mountain; he wants help. They proceed to a hollow in which Rip discovers the source of the noises. There are a group of bearded men who are playing nine pins. Rip doesn’t ask how they know his name but they offer him moonshine, which is a kind of whiskey, illicit whiskey, not legal. He decides to drink and then he falls into a deep sleep. When he wakes up, it’s pretty strange. His musket is rotting; it’s rusty. His beard is a foot long. His dog is nowhere in sight. He returns to the village and he finds he recognizes no one. His wife has died. His close friends have fallen in a war; they moved away. This is often what happens in business, especially if you’ve got a successful business. You get a blind spot. You start focusing on what works for you, and then you work at it and you work at it, and it works even better for you. The longer you work at it, and the more successful you get, the more you have a blind spot to everything else. Now, almost instantly you’re wondering where is this going. Focus is supposed to be good, right? If focus brings success, then what’s the problem with having the blind spot? There is a downside, and that’s what this episode is all about. It’s about understanding that you can have focus and you can have success, but that you can also have a blind spot. In this episode we’re going to explore three elements.  First is the concept of the Rip Van Winkle effect. The second is the opposite, which is the danger of not having that focus. The third is the solution. How do we solve this problem of focus and not focusing at the same time?    Let’s start off with the first, which is understanding the concept of the Rip Va Winkle effect. If you look around you, you will find that a lot of blogs have shut off their comments. Why have they done this? This is not just little blogs, but big blogs and mega-sized blogs. They’ve just shut off their comments. Why is this the case? The obvious reaction is maybe they’ve decided that they’re big enough they don’t need the comments, but that’s not true. Everyone likes to hear back from their customers. Nothing boosts the ego more than having 50, 70, 100, 200 comments on a single post that you made. Remember, when people comment they also send it off to Facebook and Twitter and every other place. Why turn off that channel? Why turn off the chance for people to experience your blog at a different level? The reason is very simple: that group has moved on. When you look at the most of the blogs today, even the really big ones, they have far fewer comments. It’s embarrassing, so they have to turn it off. Same thing with Facebook. At one point in time you could effectively run a business off Facebook. Slowly but surely, that tide is changing. Suddenly you find that Facebook has all these restrictions in place. Suddenly there are too many people looking at your stuff, but not the people that you want, so the tide keeps changing. If you made a successful out of blogging Or Facebook or any other medium, then it’s very simple for you to focus on that medium and not pay that much attention to everything else, so suddenly someone comes around and says, “Hey, podcasting is a big thing.” You look at them with skepticism because you tried podcasting four or five years ago and now this stuff, whatever you’re doing right now, is still working for you, so you get into that moonshine mode. You fall fast asleep, and that becomes your blind spot. This is true even for us at Psychotactics. We had a blog going around 2003 before blogs became popular in 2005; we dropped it. We had podcasts going around 2008-2009 before podcasting became popular; we dropped it. We never really stepped onto YouTube or Facebook or Twitter in a big way, or even a small way. The reason why we did that is because we had a blind spot. We had courses that were filling up super fast. I mean every single course fills up in less than an hour. We’ve had workshops in New Zealand, in the US, Canada, Netherlands, the UK, and they all fill up almost instantly. Of course we send out a newsletter weekly. We’ve done so since 2002 without  missing a single week. We’re able to sell products for as little as 9.99 all the way up to $400, $500. When you look at that kind of model, you say, “Well, that’s good, isn’t it? It’s great focus,” and it is. But the ecosystem is connected. When we first started out in 2002, if we wrote an article and we published it on another site we’d get 200 subscribers. Yes, for a single article. Then we had the blogs come out and we’d get about 50 to 60 subscribers per article. Recently, with all those comments of the blogs turned off, we probably get 2 or 3. We’re talking about really big blogs. You would think that the really big blogs would drive traffic towards you. It’s not true anymore. They’ve had to relook their strategy; we’ve had to relook our strategy. Focus is a great thing, but things can change around you and you’ve got to be watching for what’s happening around you. This takes us to our second part of today, which is chasing everything that is around you. The opposite of  focus is distraction. Most of us are not very good at focus. We are very good at being distracted. Every time someone comes up and says, “Hey, here’s a new method,” they just put the word new, improved, and we’re off like a bullet. It’s almost like the diet syndrome: the South Beach Diet, the paleo diet, the Atkins diet, the Zone diet, every single diet. We think that the next diet is going to solve our problem, but it never does. It’s the same thing for business. If you get into doing, say, podcasting, then you have to be prepared to enjoy it. You have to be prepared to love what you’re doing so that you can do it for the next five years or ten years. When we do our courses, they’re very tough. They’re very tough for me. They’re very demanding for me. When we do our workshops I’m on my feet for three days. I never sit down. I’m always running around teaching and doing stuff. Even these podcasts, I’ve already told you before, they take between three to four hours to produce even though they’re just 15 minutes or 20 minutes long. If you want to make a success of anything you’re going to have to be willing to be there for the long run But as we found out, the long run can change over time. It can twist and change, and suddenly blogs are no longer fashionable and Facebook is no longer fashionable. Maybe podcasting will not work out as effectively as it does today.

                                "description": "There’s a difference between the “four-hour work week” and magic. You can create revenue in a short week. You can’t create magic.Magic is what we all want to create with our work. Most of us love our work. It gives us purpose and satisfaction. And yes, we’d love a “three-month” paid vacation—or just any vacation at all. And that’s the goal. The goal is to work hard, but to also have a great time.  http://www.psychotactics.com/podcast/  ===== I don’t mow the lawns. I outsource it. I don’t do my accounts. It’s what keeps my accountant in business. I bake my own bread, cook my own food, but at least half of the time it’s all outsourced. In fact, when I think about it, a good chunk of my life is outsourced. I don’t build my own computers, code my own programs, generate my own electricity. I didn’t even bother to weave my own carpet. So yes, you could safely say that outsourcing is a good part of my life. What I don’t outsource is magic It’s magical to write my own articles. Do my own books. Draw my own cartoons. Answer my own email. When I think about those who keep yearning for a “four-hour” work week, I find it incredibly weird and unsettling. I think of Leonardo da Vinci spending only four hours a week, painting. I think of Michelangelo goofing off on David and just putting in the least amount of time. I think of the wine I drink and how it would taste if the wine maker decided not to put in 50-60 hours a week. I remember the movies that moved me, the food that tantalised my taste buds, the books that have elevated my senses. I think of all the magic the world has seen, felt and experienced over the years and a “four hour” workweek makes zero-sense to me. You can create money in four hours You can’t create magic. Money isn’t magic. It may seem that way, when you’re slogging in a job that you have no control over. A life that seems to pull and push you in all directions. At that point, money and magic may seem like one and the same thing. And yet it’s not. Work is magic Work well done, is something we all yearn for. And try as you may, you can’t outsource the important stuff in life. So when some internet marketer comes along and tells you that a four-hour work week is magical, they’re just equating work with money. That somehow you could work for four hours in a week, and make all the money and you’d be happy. I can assure you that you’d be happy for a while, but then you’d seek magic. And magic yup, that takes a lot more time and effort. I wake up at 4 am every day and have done so for many years I don’t have to wake up. We’ve done well over the years. We have a business which attracts really phenomenal customers. Some of them have been with us for over 12 years (considering we’re Internet-based, that’s like a hundred years). Our workshops are always full. Our courses often sell out in an hour or so sometimes 20 minutes. We’ve banked enough, own enough, travel three months in a year. Truly speaking, if we were to stop working now, we could go for at least another 20-30 years, living our comfortable lifestyle. So why wake up at 4 am? Why put in 99 cartoons in a book when people are happy to just buy text? Why bother to re-write, re-engineer our courses by 20-30% every year? It’s all extra work, isn’t it? More hours in a day, month and year that seems to slip by increasingly faster. The answer lies in magic You can outsource some stuff, and you should. But to create the Mona Lisa, David and some fine wine yup, that’s going to take a chunky 50-60 hours a week. Get used to it!..to continue listening to or reading the podcast Right click and save-as to download this episode: Four-Hour Work Week A Waste Of Time?",

I’m Sean D’Souza.  When I was growing up in India, all plywood was sold the same way. You went to a store and you picked some plywood. Then you took it home. There was no branding; it was all very, very generic.  At some point, a company called Kitply, they decided that they didn’t want to be generic anymore. They decided they wanted to charge a premium on this plywood. Now why would you go and pay a premium on plywood when you could just enter the store, get your plywood just like everybody else? Well, Kitply, they wanted to do something different. That is exactly what they did.  The Indian coastline, it’s about 7,000 kilometers; that’s about 4,500 miles. When you have a coastline that is so extensive, it also means that you have a lot of water around you. Water means humidity, and humidity means disaster for plywood, at least the plywood that you were getting in the store at that point in time. After you spent all this money on a carpenter, which is what most people did, they got a carpenter across and they built cupboards and they put the plywood in the cupboards. Then the rains would come. In India, you don’t just get rains; you get rains in June, all of July, all of August, and a bit in September as well.  That plywood would get all the moisture sitting in it. After a while, it would start to warp. Your beautiful cupboard, all your furniture, it would have this warped plywood. It would drive people crazy, but there was nothing that you could do until Kitply came up with a solution. They made their plywood waterproof. But Indians are a skeptical lot, and rightly so. If you’ve got a monsoon that goes on for several months, you want to be sure that the plywood is exceedingly good. So, Kitply not only said that their plywood was waterproof, but that it was boiling waterproof.  Now no one was going to take boiling water and throw it on the plywood, but it made a point. What is the factor that caused Kitply to stand out? Incredibly, we have to go back to a grammar lesson, because what we’re doing here is just looking at the adjective. What we’re going to cover in this podcast are three elements. First is what is the adjective. Second: how to pick it. Third: how to refashion your product around it.  Let’s start off with the first one, which is what is the adjective.  Part 1: What is the Adjective  Now, I don’t have to tell you what an adjective is. You did that in grammar class. But here’s the point. When we started out the article writing course it was very difficult for us to position it against other article writing courses, because ours is almost $3,000 and, well, the others are $400 and $500. Some are even free.  What we did was we put one little adjective. We called it The Toughest Writing Course in the World. That changed everything. Because not only did it change us, but it changed the perception of all the customers that were going to buy into that course. They knew that it wasn’t a stroll in the park. They knew that they were to expect a lot of work and effort going into that course. That one little adjective made all the difference.  This is what you need to do for your business as well. You need one little adjective to define your business. What is this business all about? When we look at a brand like Volvo for instance, immediately an adjective comes to mind, doesn’t it? It’s safety. Now Volvo hasn’t really pushed this concept of safety for a long, long time, and yet we remember it. We remember it because of that one adjective, which was safety.  If you go and read any of a dozen books, you’ll find another case study showing up, which is Domino’s Pizza. Now Domino’s Pizza has not advertised its speed for a very long time. That is because every pizza parlor will deliver it very quickly. But it still helped them make it a billion dollar brand all on the basis of one adjective, which was speed. Adjectives play an extremely important roll, and what we’ve got to figure out is how do we create our adjective.  This takes us to the second part, where we’re going to explore how we get to this adjective.  Part 2: How We Get to This Adjective  One of the big mistakes that people do when they’re coming up with their adjective is they sit down with their company, their brand, and they try to come up with an adjective for the company. At this point in time, that’s not really what you want to do. You want to come up with an adjective for a product or a service and not for your company, because your company has so much ego, so much of your ego invested in it, that it is difficult to nail down an adjective. You want to start off really simply by working with a product or a service.  When we started out, we didn’t do Psychotactics. We started out with something like the article writing course. What you need to do next is to make sure that you sit down and write about ten adjectives for that product or service, whatever it is. Just write down those ten adjectives, and then you cross out seven. This is not going to be easy, but cross out seven. You’re left with three. Out of those three, you cross out two. This is going to be extremely difficult because you think it’s this and that and that, but you want to cross out two. That leaves you with just one adjective. That defines your product or your service.  Now most people go through this procedure in one of two ways. One is absolute fluke, and the second is this organized system of ten and three and one. When we did the article writing course, we didn’t go through this whole system of ten and three and one because a customer, she suggested that it was the toughest writing course in the world, so we adopted that adjective. It became that pivotal point, that pivotal turning point where the course started to get more customers simply based on that one adjective. They wanted to sign up because it was difficult, not because it was easy.  This gives us a good chance to actually compare one course with the other. We also have a copywriting course. Now the copywriting course doesn’t have an adjective. When you describe the article writing course you say it’s the toughest course in the world. When you describe the copywriting course, you go, “Um, uh, wait. I … ” You’re lost for words. This is what the adjective does. It boils it down to one single world, but it does so much more because everything extends from there. This is what we’re going to do in the third part. We’re going to look at how it becomes the DNA of your product or service, and how you can build out from there, how it creates this whole structure, this whole ecosystem around your product and service.  Let’s go to the third part, which is how do we expand it further so that it becomes your whole DNA.  Part 3: How Do We Expand It Further So That It Becomes Your Whole DNA  When we just look at the adjective like safety or speed, it doesn’t mean anything. When we look at safety and we look at how do we make this car really safe, then we get to what Volvo has done over the years. They’ve created seat belts and crumple zones and crash test dummies and a whole range of safety devices for your car. So they are known for their safety, and the kind of people that buy a Volvo are those who are obsessed with safety.  The whole ecosystem grew around that one adjective. When you look at brands around you, you start to notice that it’s not just Volvo and Domino’s and the article writing course, but when you look at the Benjamin. This is the Benjamin Hotel in New York. They are focused on a good night’s sleep. It’s restfulness that’s their adjective. They have all kinds of pillows. They have a sleep concierge. They have cakes and stuff that help you sleep better, and they’ll even give you a guarantee if you don’t get a good night’s sleep, even if someone else is drilling in the building next door. Everything they do is built around that one concept of sleep, that one adjective of restfulness.  When I was growing up in India we had a television. It was called Onida TV. When they launched that TV, the slogan was “Neighbours envy and owner’s pride.” They didn’t talk about the features of the TV, the size of the TV, nothing. It was just this devil the whole time, this sneaky little devil. He showed up on the screen and he did all kinds of antics. At the end of it, it was just about envy. They didn’t talk about anything. That one adjective made Onida one of the largest-selling televisions in India.  We live in New Zealand, as you know. If you think of New Zealand, what do you think of? You think of beauty. You think of purity. That’s what New Zealand is all about. It’s 100% pure. That’s what their advertising and marketing is all about. That’s their adjective. But that’s not what New Zealand had about a hundred years ago. Their slogan was about cure, not pure. You came here for health benefits, not to go around and look at the waterfalls and go over the mountains and do all those fabulous things that you can do in New Zealand.  That adjective can change over time. Funny, no one even noticed, did they? In fact, some adjectives are under the radar. You look at Facebook for instance, and you think what could be the adjective for Facebook. But it’s very obvious, isn’t it? It’s sticky. Everything they do is designed to make you get back to Facebook. Recently they even made you, forced you to get the Messenger app if you wanted to get some of the messages that friends would send to you.  Why did they do that? Because if you didn’t go to Facebook, you’d probably miss out on the messages. If you had the Messenger app, that would pop up on your phone and you’d see it, so it would pull you back to the site. Facebook is all about stickiness. It’s about going there several times a day, being addicted to it, communicating with your friends, doing whatever you have to do, but you have to go back to Facebook. It’s an addiction.  When you think of Amazon, you think wow, that’s a great selection. Maybe that is their adjective. But no, it’s below the radar. Amazon’s entire business is built around speed. They have two-day shipping, one-day shipping. This time I was in the United States and I was in Washington D.C. I had bought this mic that I’m using right now. Well not quite, I had ordered the wrong mic. It got shipped in and then I wanted to return it, so I did. I packed it up and I was waiting for the courier to come in.  By the time the courier came in, the new mic had already been delivered. There’s an adjective in place even though we might not see as part of the slogan. Sometimes you can have an adjective that is defined by the title. For instance, when I wrote Dartboard Pricing, the concept of dartboard itself talks about something that is unusual, that is kind of random. That gives it that adjective. It gives it that curiosity factor, and it attracts you to that product or to that service.  Now, the question does arise: can this adjective last forever? In most cases it can go for a very, very long time. In Domino’s Pizza’s case, it didn’t last forever, but they’re still a billion dollar brand. When you are selling your products or services, it’s critical to have this adjective because this is what we do in normal life. We describe other people. We describe places. We describe movies. We describe products. When you have that adjective in place, it not only helps to create that description, but it becomes the DNA for your product or service.  The reason why you see so many products and services without any game plan is simply because they don’t have this simple grammar lesson in place: the adjective. Once you have the adjective, everything builds around it. That is really what we’ve covered today.  Summary  In part one we just looked at the fact that our grammar lesson was very important. We needed to have an adjective. In part two we looked at the fact that we could probably list ten adjectives and then get rid of seven, and then get rid of another two until we had a single adjective. Finally, we looked at all of these products and services like the Benjamin, and Onida, and New Zealand, and Amazon, and Facebook. There are dozens of examples of very successful brands. At the core of them is the DNA. At the core of them is this factor of the adjective and how the whole ecosystem is built around this one adjective.  If you’re wondering what is the adjective for Psychotactics, well, there is an adjective for the brand itself. The adjective for Psychotactics is elegance. When you buy a product or a service from Psychotactics, you experience that elegance. There is an elegance int system which goes with very tiny increments. There’s an elegance in the cartoons. There’s an elegance in the way the text is written. The same thing applies to the podcast. There is the music and the way the whole podcast is recorded. We’re always working towards that elegance. But on a ground level, every product and every service is going to need their own adjective as well.  Yes, your company is going to need some kind of adjective. It’s not critical right now but it’s going to need it over time, and you’re going to have to bring out that adjective in your marketing material. Which we haven’t done, by the way, but we will once the new website is up. Companies need the adjective but every product and every service is going to need the adjective as well.  That brings us to the end of this podcast. I hope you’ve enjoyed it. If you do enjoy it, then share it with your friends. Talk about it on Twitter or Facebook. That will really help.

I’m Sean D’Souza.  The Cherokee elder stood before his students and he told them of two wolves that live and battle within each one of us. One of these wolves, he explained, is ill-natured. It sees the worst in people and things. It thinks only of itself. It is vengeful, jealous, arrogant. It’s full of ego and false pride. The other wolf sees the best in people and things. It is kind, it is generous, it is peaceful. It is full of integrity and respect for love itself and others.  One of the students asks the chief which one of these wolves wins the battle. The elder replied, “Whichever one you feed. Whichever one you feed, that is your identity.” When I started out in marketing, it was very easy for me to get fed by a lot of stuff around me. When you’re on Facebook, when you’re on the internet, there is a whole lot of junk out there. That junk makes you feel small. It makes you feel insignificant, and you’ve got to build an identity with the situation around you. How do you do it?  In today’s episode we will cover the three elements of what was my journey. Also, it’s going to be your journey. The first element is one of feeling like a fraud. The second one is just one of success. What does it mean? Finally, the third one, which is one of space and why it’s so important.  Part 1: Feeling Like A Fraud  When you look at January of 2001, I didn’t really feel like a fraud, but by December of 2001 I was feeling more and more insecure. What happened between January and December to create all this insecurity? For many years, even as I was a kid, I used to draw. I was extremely shy, and I’ve been drawing my whole life. I became a cartoonist. I became a writer. That’s what shy people do. As I moved into the world of marketing, that completely threw me. I didn’t know that much about marketing. I didn’t know how people think, what they do, how they buy, the prices that they decide on.  But I read this book by Jim Collins, which was called Good to Great. It asked what can you be the best in the world at. I thought I love the cartooning, I love the writing, but I want to do something different. The answer lay, strangely, in marketing. I was not into marketing. I just didn’t understand it. In all the years that I had run the cartooning business, I had done very little organized marketing. It was a good thing, because we moved to New Zealand and the public library was accessible, which was different from India.  I stepped into the library and I picked up ten books. Then I picked up another ten books. Then eventually the librarian realized that I was picking up a lot of books so they gave me an allocation where I could take 30 books at a time. I read those books. The more I read it, the less confident I got, the more I felt like a fraud.  But because I had no choice, I went out there and I spoke with clients. I spoke at small little events. The feeling of being a fraud didn’t go away. It always seemed like someone would tap me on the shoulder and say, “Okay, your time is up. You’ve been talking nonsense for quite a while now and it’s time for me to get in here.”  Six months passed, and a year passed. That tap never came. Then I did a trip to the US and I met with other marketers and I spoke with them. An interesting thing happened. I realized that these guys don’t know that much more than I do. In fact, I know quite a few things that they don’t know. That’s when that fraud label just slipped off and fell into the drain. It never came back again.  It never came back again for me as a marketer but it came back again in different ways. When I write a book, for instance, I just wrote the book on Dartboard Pricing, again, that whole fraud feeling came out. I have made this presentation in Chicago. I made another presentation in Denver. I’ve written so much about pricing. It’s all on the website. It’s on the blog. It’s in our membership site at 5000bc. I’ve explained it at length.  The feeling of being a fraud comes out because you feel what else is there to say. If I write this book, people will have read all of this information. They will think wait a second, he’s just rehashing everything. Then when I send out early copies of the book to clients just so that they can read and send out some testimonials, and they come back and go, “I’m so excited,” and I think what, I already said all this stuff.  It’s different. They haven’t experienced it from the concept of a book, a system, step by step going through the whole logic. Even though I may feel like a fraud when I’m writing the book or putting it out there, that’s just a bit of my own insecurity coming in. They don’t feel that at all. They feel this stuff is really cool.  This feeling keeps coming back. I remember when we were in Washington D.C. and we did a workshop on The Brain Audit. I was very nervous. I didn’t sleep that night simply because when I stood in front of that audience I thought they’ve already read The Brain Audit. These were people who bought the first version of The Brain Audit, version two, version three. Now they’re sitting in the audience and I’m going to say the very same thing. I’m going to tell them exactly what they read about.  I should have paid attention. They bought version one, version two, version three. Obviously every version was bringing them a different angle, a different perspective, and my presentation was going to bring a different perspective. That’s not how I felt. I felt like a fraud. I felt like something is going to go wrong. Someone is going to tap me on the shoulder.  No one did. In fact, when we came out after the first break, everyone was going, “Wow, I didn’t know The Brain Audit was like this. I perceived it to be different.” That’s it. You start out in life feeling a little insecure. You change professions, you feel insecure. You change your system. You write a book. You give a presentation. It doesn’t matter what happens. The moment you change midstream, it’s like being in a strange city and you’re not very confident. You’re completely lost. Your GPS is not working, and your soul needs to be a pilot, as Sting would say.  But Sting isn’t sitting in my chair, is he? I didn’t feel that way, and it comes back. What you’ve got to understand is that part of your identity is always going to be that you’re unsure, and that’s great.  This takes us to the second part of today, which is the whole feeling of success. What is success, and how do you cope with it?  Part 2: The Whole Feeling of Success  When you ask people what is their definition of success, they come up with various definitions. The thing that shows up is a lot of philosophy. People get very philosophical about the fact that success is this and success is that. When you look at the books and you look at the awards, the success parameters become very claustrophobic. In New Zealand we have an award for the Fast 50. On Forbes you have maybe the top 100 companies or the top 100 CEOs. Their success is all benchmarked by how many dollars they have in the bank or how quickly they got to the top.  When you look at so many blogs, what you find is the definition of success becomes one of taking shortcuts, of things like the four-hour work week. Four hours? What kind of genius can you create in four hours in a work week? Sometimes you’ll get the contrast. They will talk about quick meals and then slow cooking. Mostly success is benchmarked by money, by speed, and by shortcuts.  That becomes our identity, because it’s all around us. This is how it’s always been. It’s not just something that showed up yesterday. When we go back 100 years, 200 years, 500 years, 1,000 years, success has always been about money, speed, and shortcuts. And power, let’s not forget about power.  The point is, as human beings this makes us very happy: the money, the speed, the power. All this stuff makes us really happy. Fair enough, because we can’t really do without it. But we can also change things a bit and we can set a different benchmark.  When I started out Psychotactics I didn’t know how to set this benchmark, but I knew that I wanted to be different in some way. Over the years, this difference has morphed. Suddenly our books, the ebooks, are different from everybody else’s ebooks. They’re different because they have less information but more depth of that information. Instead of pummeling you with endless amounts of data and more data, they cluster around a few important elements.  For instance, if you read Dartboard Pricing you would find that when we deal with sequential pricing, only three points are being covered, but those three points are being covered in-depth. When you cover this in-depth, what you have is the power to empower. No, yeah, power to empower. Empowerment is really what happens there. Over time, this has become one of the more important elements of what we would define as success. It’s not the ability to sell more books or courses or workshops, but to be more like a pilot that takes all the passengers across. It’s very easy to start a course or a workshop or have a book and not have everyone consume it. Our goal has been different. Our goal is how do we get them to the endpoint. That becomes a benchmark for success.  On a personal scale, the Three Month Vacation becomes a benchmark for success. How can we run our business so that we can get away, that we can eat the food that we want, travel the way we want, relax, and then come back refreshed so that we can do better work. That has become a benchmark for success.  Now invariably, the money and the shortcuts and the power and all that stuff has got to sneak in, but it doesn’t become the whole reason why we do stuff. When I go to events, I meet with a lot of speakers. They’re all hanging around the corridor. They’re not essentially speaking to anybody else but the other speakers. All of them are saying exactly the same thing. They want to be home with their munchkins and they want to spend time with them at the swimming pool. They want to go to school with them. They want to do all this stuff.  Yet when they present themselves to the world they’re talking about I did three million miles. I made so much money. I spoke at so many events. They present a completely different view to the world, yet when you’re backstage, when they’re in the corridor, they’re talking about being home, about not wanting to friendly, about being sick about getting on another plane.  What they seem to present as success is not really what they feel is success. Going to that school event, going to that pool and jumping in the pool with the kid, that’s success to them. I thought that the Three Month Vacation was kind of normal. I thought that people needed breaks. Maybe not three months, but I thought that they needed breaks.  When I meet with a lot of my friends in marketing and they talk about wow, it’s amazing that you’re able to do this … These are people who are extremely, what we call, successful. That’s when I realized that setting these benchmarks for myself, setting this identity of who I really am, is critical. This is what you’ve got to do as well.  What is really your identity of success, other than the money and the power and the shortcuts, which are fine. It’s just that you’ve got to have that other identity that you know wow, I’ve reached this goal. Maybe that benchmark, that identity is just to get to the beach 300 days in a year and that’s it, and then you know. This is measurable. I can do it and it doesn’t involve that other stuff that other people are portraying.  Our identity is almost restricted to being a fraud at some point right through our career. The second thing is one of success and how we define success, and how the world defines success. The third one, and this is something that a lot of people don’t talk about, is just the factor of space, how space defines who we are as human beings.  Part 3: The Factor of Space  What is this factor of space? I was on my way back home after a walk. I always listen to the podcast on the way back home. I was listening to this writer, Pico Iyer, speaking on the TED stage. He came up with a statement that I had to stop and I had to write it down, because it was so interesting. He was talking about home and movement. He said it’s only by stopping movement that you can see where to go. It’s only by steeping out of your life and your world that you can see what you most deeply care about, and then you can find a home.  To me that has been home, that peace, that pause, that stop for refuelling. That has been the most critical element of my life. It’s what gave me identity. It’s what allows me to come back refreshed and do stuff that I want to do.  This resonates with me at a different level as well. Because, several years ago I listen to philosopher Wayne Dyer. He used to say it’s the silence between the notes that make the music. I heard it a dozen times and I couldn’t really figure out what he was saying. Then one day I rushed out to the car and I was telling my wife, “Do you know what that means? It’s the quiet. It’s the quiet that makes the music, because when there’s just note after note after note, we get cacophony.” She gave me that look that wives often give you, like what took you so long.  Even if you go back in time to one of the greatest masters of our time, Leonardo Da Vinci, he said you have to step away from your work to get perspective. Without space, it’s hard to have an identity that you’re really looking for, that you want to create. It becomes what people call the dream. They’re always searching for it, but to create a real identity instead of a dream, you have to step away and you have to look at yourself from a different space. Then you come back a changed person. You’re not completely changed but somewhere some of those notes have changed. That makes for beautiful music.  The Cherokee elder stood before his students and told them of the two wolves that live and battle within each of us. One of those wolves, he explained, is ill-nature. It sees the worst in people and things. It thinks only of itself. It is vengeful, and jealous, and arrogant, and full of ego and false pride. The other wolf sees the best in people and things. It is kind, it is generous, it is peaceful. It is full of integrity and respect for love itself and others.  One of the students asks the chief which one of these wolves wins the battle. The elder replied, “Whichever one you feed.” You’re going to be fed with this concept of being a fraud. You’re going to be fed with this concept of imaginary success, what the world defines as success, not what you define as success. The wolf that you really need to feed is the one that brings you peace, that brings that space so that you can create your own music.  Summary  That brings us to the end of this podcast, but before we go, let’s see the one thing that you can do today. Personally, I think it’s hard to get over that feeling of being a fraud. It comes back no matter how confident you are. Believe me, I’m a very confident person. Yes, we’ve got to create that space. We have to say let’s not take a three month vacation right now but let’s take a weekend maybe two weeks from now, just a break. No email, no phone, just a break. Definitely no Facebook.  What’s the one thing you can do today?  What you can do today is to define your benchmark, your identity of success. What is it that brings you or will bring you the most happiness? That will make a huge difference. It will make a difference to who you are and where you’re going to go tomorrow. That will determine which wolf you’re going to feed.  I appreciate all of you who’ve been writing in about this podcast. If you want to reach me, I’m on Twitter@SeanD’Souza, on Facebook at Sean D’Souza, and then at sean@psychotactics.com.

Yes, one very important thing: I struggle to get to iTunes and leave a review because every time I’m listening to this I’m away from my computer, but I am on my phone. If you look below your phone, there is a little I button, especially if you’re on an iPhone. If you click on that I button you’ll get more information and there a link to the iTunes site. If you can leave a review, that would be really, really cool.  That’s me, Sean D’Souza, from the Three Month Vacation, saying thanks again and bye for now. Go feed that wolf.  You’re still listening?  People often ask me: Have you ever skipped a vacation? The answer is yes. We did that once. We thought it was more important for us to work and complete some projects and stuff. We did in four months what we normally do in three. That time that we should have been spending away, we were working and getting more and more tired and frustrated.  Then eventually we just got on a plane and went off to Sydney for a week. It was terrible. Not Sydney, just the week. It was like you just did something for the sake of doing it. It wasn’t planned or interesting. Then we came back and we were different but not as different as if it were planned. Yes, we have skipped it. There you have it, a little snippet from the Psychotactics archive. Bye for now.

I lived in Mumbai, India for a long time and back then, I used to be a cartoonist. I wasn't so much into marketing or not into marketing at all. Even as I say that, somehow it seems odd and the reason for that is because even without realizing it, I was using the concepts of marketing, so let me tell you this story. Even though I grew up in Mumbai, I mostly drew for newspapers and magazines and places like that.    The pay is terrible there because all of the syndicates like Universal feature syndicate and all these syndicates that send out cartoons, they just mass dump the cartoons into other countries, including India.   It's so cheap that a newspaper or a magazine can just bring dozens of them. If you look at the cartoon pages, they are there every single day, a whole page of cartoons. There I was competing against this absolutely dirt cheap, probably 20 cents a cartoon scenario and of course I couldn't make a living doing that, so I started looking out for companies because companies do presentations and within presentations, you can use cartoons. At one point I picked on this computer company called Compaq.   They showed some initial interest in the cartoons, but then they went quiet. Now as I said, I wasn't doing any marketing back then, but I followed up and then I followed up and then I followed up and then I followed up and followed up. One day, their manager called up and he said, \"Can you come over?\" He took me to their boardroom and there I was in front of fifteen or twenty people sitting there and he said, \"Tell them what you did.\" I'm completely confused now. It's like, \"What did I do?\"    He says, \"Tell them when you started communicating with me,\" and so I did and he says, \"Tell them how many times you communicated with me,\" and of course I followed his instruction. I did want the job after all. Then he turned to the entire group which happened to be in sales and marketing and he said, \"This is the difference.    This is why he is standing here. This is why he's going to get the job. It not because of his skill, it's not because of pretty much anything I know about him, it's because he followed up and because he was persistent, that's why he's standing here and that is a lesson for you in sales and marketing.\"   Yes, it was a lesson for me in sales and marketing too because when you're a small business especially, you don't know whether you should follow up. If you're a big business, you can just buy ads and flood them in the marketplace and repeat them ten thousand times and maybe they'll do the job and maybe they won't, but you have those deep pockets, but if you're a small business, what do you do? You follow up, but how do you follow up without becoming a pest?   The first thing we're going to cover today is how do you follow up without becoming a pest. The second thing is how often do you follow up and then we'll look at some real life situations from Amazon and also from our site at Psychotactics and how it has made a difference to our business. When I say a difference, this has been the difference between a client buying nothing and ending up buying twenty or twenty-five thousand dollars worth of product and services over time.   Let's start with the first topic which is what are the tools that you use to follow up? What are the systems that you're going to use to follow up? There are actually two tools that probably encompass everything that you need to do with follow up and that is to educate and the second one is to sell.    Now both of them are incredibly important. You might think that the education is more important than the sales, but it's not. Both of them are very, very important, so when I first started out as a cartoonist and I just moved to New Zealand, I was not only a small business, but a small business with no clients and with no understanding of what people in New Zealand were buying and where to go. In short, it was like just being born in a business. It was brand new.   Of course, you do what most businesses do. You get in touch with clients and this is a consulting business, a business that's not online. You get in touch with them, you go to some meetings and then you get a name of someone and that's what I did. I got some names of some art directors and I started sending them a calendar. Not just a calendar once a year, but a calendar every month. Now it would have been cheaper to send it once a year, but they got a reminder from me every single month and it was a useful calendar. It had space to write down things and yes, it was just photocopied on color paper and it did the job.   That is a kind of educational followup. If you're online, your followup tends to be with articles, with PDFs, with reports, with some sort of giveaway and as we know, this is increasingly getting harder every minute because of the fragmentation of media. It used to be easy before or easier, but it's getting much harder, so you've got to consider that you are going to follow up both offline and online and we do this ourselves. We get clients and then we send them a bar of chocolate. We send them postcards.   Now consider that our business has been online since 2002, so we've got a reputation. We've got clients that love our work and yet, we're still using that age-old system of offline marketing. We're still following up bit by bit. We still keep in touch with clients through email, just sending them a note saying how are you doing, what's happening and yes, it's all taking time. We're all super busy, but the point is that once you have a client, once you have a contact, your job is to keep following up.   Now you can follow up with educational material like articles or reports or podcasts or webinars or anything, but as long as they are on a regular basis. Now what you might not realize is that following up and selling your product is just as important. Notice what you do when you buy a book. Say you buy a book by an author. Say it's James Patterson. What happens next? You want to buy another book by the same author and then a third book by the same author, so in effect, when you don't have a product and you don't follow up with selling a product, you are preventing the client from coming back.   At least a fifth or a fourth of your communication with clients needs to be one of sales. There's education or there's entertainment or whatever you're sending out for the three-fourth, but one-fourth needs to be some kind of offer, some kind of sales, some kind of incentive so that they can then decide I want to buy this product or service. This might not seem very intuitive at the start, but it's what holds the business together. It generates the income and it enables you to then follow up or to get resources who will then follow up for you. With that, we end the first part, which is follow up with both information as well as something that the customer is going to buy.   This of course takes us to the second part which is how often should you follow up? When we send out something and we expect a response, we usually get a blank and that's not because people don't want to buy, it's just that you're selling at the wrong time. What do I mean by wrong time? Well, when you want to sell something, that's not the exact time that people want to buy something, so you've got to prepare them for that moment. If you want the six secrets to following up, well, the first secret is follow up. The second one is follow up. The third one, follow up. Fourth one, follow up. The fifth one, follow up and you know the sixth one, which is to follow up again.   Even if you're not sending out a newsletter, even if you're not doing anything that most people do in terms of marketing, if you're going to spend the time initiating a meeting with someone, then you want to make sure that you follow up at least six times. Take for example this podcast.  Now, admittedly, we've been online for ages and you would think well, you just send out an email blast and everyone's going to go to the page and put in the reviews and subscribe and do what you expect and they don't and so I had an online Google Docs document and I put in the list of the people that I was contacting and I was contacting twenty-five people a day, every day, so guess what happens?   You're looking at the number of people that you have communicated with over the past five years or ten years. I looked at my sent box and there were twenty-two thousand emails that had gone out. Now even if two hundred of them responded and did what I was expecting, that would mean two hundred into six interactions which would be twelve hundred interactions.   Luckily for me, some people respond quickly. Some people don't, but you've got to have that system in place because you spent all that time creating the podcast, putting the music together, putting it up, getting all the software; there's an enormous amount of effort that goes into setting up something, creating something and then we get dejected when people don't respond the first time. You can't do that. You have to keep following up repeatedly over and over again.   The point is that if you follow up with some sort of incentive, some sort of information, some sort of curiosity, it becomes less of a painful experience. When it came to my cartoon career, I was sending out those little calendars. When it came to Psychotactics, we used to send out newsletters. We gave away free products. We sold some products. When it came to the podcast, I was just following up with the people I knew, just through email; no incentive, but a certain amount of curiosity of what we were covering in the podcast, but there was a strategy for follow up and that's the message I want to get across to you today.   What was the result of this follow up? After about ten days of following up, we got thirty-five reviews on iTunes. That was enough. That got us into the new and newsworthy section of iTunes, so we debuted at 55 on iTunes, which is good. I mean, you've spend all that time, you're getting a result. The next time when you're feeling nice and dejected that no one is responding to your stuff, remember, all of us have to do the groundwork. All of us have to follow up. If you don't have a follow up strategy in place, it's not going to work.    But what if you were a big company like Amazon.com? Would you then do this followup? If you're on Amazon or you bought anything off Amazon, you know immediately what I'm talking about and that is that they follow up incessantly. They follow up in different ways.    This morning, for instance, I wasn't interested in buying any books; however, I had bought a book in the past and they sent me an email saying which other books would you recommend to readers who've read this book? Well, that was a different question. I mean, it wasn't about leaving a testimonial. It wasn't about rating anything, it was about which other book would you like to recommend. They also put a link there about here are some other books that readers recommend and so I got curious. I went to see which books others recommended and of course, I ended up buying two books.   Now, the point isn't that you don't have the power of Amazon and you don't have the data base and you don't have this and you don't have that. You have to remember that you have obstacles and the obstacle becomes the way because there is no other way but to go through the obstacle, around the obstacle or over the obstacle.   Amazon, with all its resources, with all of its money, is still following up. We have a strategy at Psychotactics which involves attraction, conversion and consumption. Attraction is the followups that you have to do before someone buys a product and so you send them all of these newsletters or these reports or the podcasts or webinars or whatever content you're creating or sometimes even paid products that you just give away at that point in time.   Once they buy something; let's say they go and buy The Brain Audit, we then have a post followup, which is a consumption followup which is getting the customer to consume what they bought. While this also takes a lot of time, you have to put in a whole bunch of auto-responders together; the point is that we want customers to consume the products.    We don't want them to just buy it, we want them to use it.   It's when you follow up and when you use technology to follow up and when you just follow up using old grind method, that's when you get clients that stay with you and that is one of the secrets of why we can take so much time off every year. That's why we can take our three month vacation. We don't have to go out there and get new clients all the time. We can just follow up with existing clients and they help us in meeting our goals.   Let's summarize what we learned today. The first point we covered was how do you follow up without being a pest and you do this with education, which is good; not just your average stuff, but really good stuff. You do this with sales as well. You want to sell them a great product. You want to sell them a great service. You want to get that through because the moment they buy something from you, there is greater investment in your system, in your methodology, but how often do you follow up?    Well, you follow up before they buy, six, seven, eight times; at least six times and then after they buy, you follow up as well, helping them to consume the product. It's called consumption. Finally, remember that even the giants like Apple and Amazon with all their budgets, they're constantly following up and while it's easy for us to say we don't have that kind of money or infrastructure, we do have systems and all we have to do is work out a strategy to follow up.    It's not going to happen today or tomorrow, but over time, that strategy gets to be better. If you've received a chocolate from us or if you've received a postcard or you've received an email, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. What's the one thing that you can do today?   When I went to Compaq, I just didn't have any strategy. When I launched this podcast, despite being as busy as you know I am, I had to follow up, over and over again, but I had a strategy and I had an Excel spreadsheet. For those of you who know how much I love Excel, well, I had an Excel spreadsheet, so that's how keen I was on followup and that's how keen you should be on followup. Any followup strategy is going to be better than no followup strategy. It gives you a much clearer idea of what you're going to do in the weeks, months and years to follow, but even so, for the next few months, have some sort of strategy, any strategy will do. It's still better.   That brings us to the end of this episode. If you haven't already subscribed, you know what to do. Go to iTunes, subscribe, give us a rating, help us along. We need the help.
